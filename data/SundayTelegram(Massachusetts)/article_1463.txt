WASHINGTON -- A presidential commission on Friday made 16 urgent recommendationsto improve the nation's cybersecurity, including creating a nutritional-typelabel to help consumers shop wisely and appointing a new internationalambassador on the subject -- weeks before President-elect Donald Trump takesoffice.The release of the 100-page report follows the worst hacking of U.S. governmentsystems in history and accusations by the Obama administration that Russiameddled in the U.S. presidential election by hacking Democrats.The Presidential Commission on Enhancing National Cybersecurity urged immediateaction within two to five years and suggested the Trump administration consideracting on some proposals within its first 100 days.The commission recommended that Trump create an assistant to the president forcybersecurity, who would report through the national security adviser, andestablish an ambassador for cybersecurity, who would lead efforts to createinternational rules. It urged steps, such as getting rid of traditionalpasswords, to end the threat of identity theft by 2021 and said Trump'sadministration should train 100,000 new cybersecurity workers by 2020.Other ideas included helping consumers to judge products using an independentnutritional-type label for technology products and services."What we've been doing over the last 15 to 20 years simply isn't working, andthe problem isn't going to be fixed simply by adding more money," said StevenChabinsky, a commission member and the global chair of the data, privacy andcybersecurity practice for White & Case LLP, an international law firm.He said the group wanted the burden of cybersecurity "moved away from everycomputer user and handled at higher levels," including internet providers andproduct developers who could ensure security by default and design "foreveryone's benefit."The White House requested the report in February and intended it to serve as atransition memo for the next president. The commission included 12 of what theWhite House described as the brightest minds in business, academia, technologyand security. It was led by Tom Donilon, Obama's former national securityadviser.The panel studied sharing information with private companies about cyberthreats, the lack of talented American security engineers and distrust of theU.S. government by private businesses, especially in Silicon Valley. Classifieddocuments stolen under Obama by Edward Snowden, a contractor for the NationalSecurity Agency, revealed government efforts to hack into the data pipelinesused by U.S. companies to serve customers overseas.One commissioner, Herbert Lin of Stanford University, said some seniorinformation technology managers distrust the federal government as much as theydistrust China, widely regarded as actively hacking in the U.S.President Barack Obama said in a written statement after meeting with Donilonthat his administration will take additional action "wherever possible" to buildon its efforts make progress before he leaves office next month. He urged Trumpand the next Congress to treat the recommendations as a guide."Now it is time for the next administration to take up this charge and ensurethat cyberspace can continue to be the driver for prosperity, innovation, andchange both in the United States and around the world," Obama said.It was not immediately clear whether Trump would accept the group'srecommendations. Trump won the election on promises to reduce governmentregulations, although decades of relying on market pressure or asking businessesto voluntarily make their products and services safer have been largelyineffective.Trump's presidential campaign benefited from embarrassing disclosures in hackedemails stolen from the Democratic National Committee, Hillary Clinton's campaignstaff and others, and Trump openly invited Russian hackers to find and releasetens of thousands of personal emails that Clinton had deleted from the privateserver she had used to conduct government business as secretary of state. Healso disputed the Obama administration's conclusion that Russia was responsiblefor the Democratic hackings.Though Trump is a prolific user of online social media services, especiallyTwitter, he is rarely seen using a computer. His campaign manager, KellyanneConway, tweeted a photograph Monday of Trump working on an Apple laptop insidehis office at Trump Tower. He testified in a deposition in 2012 that he did notown a personal computer or smartphone, and in another deposition earlier thisyear said he deliberately does not use email.Trump has already promised his own study by a "Cyber Review Team" of people hesaid he will select from military, law enforcement and private sectors. He saidhis team will develop mandatory cyber awareness training for all U.S. governmentemployees, and he has proposed a buildup of U.S. military offensive anddefensive cyber capabilities that he said will deter foreign hackers.The new report suggested that the government should remain the only organizationresponsible for responding to large-scale attacks by foreign countries.Obama has a mixed legacy on cybersecurity.Under Obama, hackers stole personal data from the U.S. Office of PersonnelManagement on more than 21 million current, former and prospective governmentemployees, including details of security-clearance background investigations forfederal agents, intelligence employees and others. The White House also failedin its efforts to convince Congress to pass a national law -- similar to lawspassed in some states -- to require hacked companies to notify affectedcustomers.But the Obama administration also became more aggressive about publiclyidentifying foreign governments it accused of hacking U.S. victims, arrestedsome high-profile hackers overseas, successfully shut down some large networksof hacked computers used to attack online targets, enacted but never actuallyused economic sanctions against countries that hacked American targets and useda sophisticated new cyber weapon called Stuxnet against Iran's main nuclearenrichment facilities.Congress passed a new law in late 2015 to encourage companies and the governmentto share information about online threats.President Barack Obama talks to media in February about the Commission onEnhancing National Cybersecurity.
