Housing was the talk of the campaign two presidential elections ago, but itstayed under the radar in the 2016 race, leaving plenty of room to speculateabout President-elect Donald Trump's likely mortgage policy for the next fouryears.On the one hand, without a crisis, observers said there is little incentive forhim to move quickly on the issue.But the unresolved question of what to do with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac - bothin conservatorship since before Barack Obama's election - will loom large overthe future Trump administration.Exactly how Trump would address the issue is a complete mystery. The issue wasnever raised on the campaign trail."The disappointing part [of the election] has been that the Trump campaign hashad very little to say about housing," said Patrick Sinks, the chief executiveof MGIC Investment Corp. and the chairman of U.S. Mortgage Insurers, a tradegroup for the private mortgage insurance industry.Trump may also be reluctant to weigh in on a subject that has tripped uppolicymakers in the past."Lots of people have put a lot of thought into [government-sponsored enterprise]reform, but it is incredibly difficult to get a super-majority consensus on it,"said Dennis Kelleher, the head of the advocacy group Better Markets.With the GOP in control of the House and the Senate closely divided, it's clearthat any housing finance reform legislation would need significant bipartisansupport - and it's not at all obvious how that can happen. The last bipartisaneffort died two years ago after progressive Democrats said the bill would not doenough to promote affordable housing."Any new housing policies will have to be bipartisan and carefully negotiated,"said John Dalton, head of the Financial Services Roundtable's Housing PolicyCouncil.Yet Trump may eventually have to address the issue as Fannie and Freddie areprojected to run out of capital by 2018. The two GSEs have a line of credit withthe Treasury Department, but as part of their conservatorship they are requiredto transfer their profits and a portion of their operating capital to theTreasury, a structure that was meant to force Congress and the nextadministration to reform the housing finance market.Some speculated that Trump will at least start allowing the GSEs to rebuildcapital so that the issue will not come to a head. Recapitalizing the GSEs andreleasing them from conservatorship might prove too difficult a lift, givenopposition from Republican and Democratic lawmakers."We believe that recapping and releasing the GSEs will prove difficult withoutlegislation, but our sense is that there is a high likelihood of capitalretention if Trump takes the White House," wrote Isaac Boltansky, an analyst atCompass Point Research & Trading in a note to clients.Ed Groshans, an analyst at Height Securities, argued in a note to clients thatTrump would delay dealing with the issue as long as possible.The complete exclusion of housing as a priority means that the issue of housingfinance reform would not come to the forefront unless he were reelected to asecond term," he wrote. "In our view, the GSEs will continue to pay all earningsto Treasury well into the second term of the next President, assumingreelection."Joseph Murin, who previously served as president of Ginnie Mae during the GeorgeW. Bush and Obama administrations, said Trump may leave the issue to GOPlawmakers."There are people on the Hill eager to retool the government-sponsoredenterprises and move them forward," said Murin, now the chairman of theinvestment advisory firm Jjam Financial. "Folks on that side of the aislebelieve in housing finance reform. They believe that a structure needs to be putin place that allows the government to participate in catastrophic coverage, notfirst-tier coverage."BEYOND GSESOutside of housing finance reform, Trump is expected to shake things up. Somepredicted that he would seek new leadership of the Federal Housing FinanceAgency."[Director] Mel Watt will be gone," said A.W. Pickel III, president of theMidwest Division at AmCap Mortgage Ltd. in Houston, a lender and servicer ofgovernment and GSE loans.Trump is also expected to be supportive of big businesses, but it is unclearwhat his single-family-housing policies are or what they could portend forsmaller lenders, said Brent Nyitray, director of capital markets at iServeResidential Lending in Stamford, Conn.While Trump has been involved in home mortgage lending and has ties to theindustry, more of his work has involved large commercial real estate projects."It could be good or it could be bad [for single-family lenders]," said Nyitray.Trump and the Republicans have shown interest in reforming the ConsumerFinancial Protection Bureau, but Senate Democrats retain enough influence tomake that challenging at best.Still, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Director Richard Cordray's term willexpire in 2018, giving Trump an opportunity to influence the agency at thattime. The agency's fate may also depend on pending litigation.The GOP will also likely to push legislation that will lighten the regulatoryburden on lenders."It's pretty obvious the Republicans are [for] less government in housing," saidBrian Montgomery, vice chairman of The Collingwood Group and a former FederalHousing Administration commissioner.But no one expects sweeping action because other issues are higher priority,such as health care reform."If you ask most lenders, the market works today," Sinks said. "A lender wantsto originate a loan, insure that loan and turn around and sell that loan to theGSEs and replenish their capital and start the process over again. That works.And it keeps humming along."As long as that remains true, the incentive to take big chances won't be there."The bigger issue is what the right role for government in housing is. That'sgoing to take legislative action and [lawmakers] just don't seem to be in ahurry to resolve it."URL: http://www.nationalmortgagenews.com//
