Palmyra school board member Ralph Duquette was asked to step down from the boardby parents concerned about inflammatory comments he made on social media, mostlyregarding politics.Kris Keck and Cynthia Lyons, both parents in the school district and coaches onthe Palmyra swim team, first went public with concerns at the board's votingmeeting Nov. 10. Other parents voiced their concerns Thursday."As a member of the school board your role is to represent and look out for thebest interest of the student, faculty and community members of this district,"Antounette "Toni" Shughart, a concerned parent, said. "The people here tonightare not upset with your choice of presidential candidate as your tweets imply,but we are disturbed with your language and intimidation tactics used on socialmedia."A few members of the audience pointed to Duquette's right to free speech underthe First Amendment."Yes there is freedom of speech in our country, but as an elected official it isyour responsibility, while serving the community and the students of thisdistrict, to maintain an ethical, positive role," Shughart said.Other parents echoed Shughart's comments, and the group asked Duquette to stepdown from his position.Parents were concerned about Duquette tweeting profanities and their childrenseeing them online."You cannot name a single kid that I follow on Twitter," Duquette said.A teenage boy tweeted at Duquette during the school day, and he admitted that heresponded."Your son sending me a tweet during the school day I found problematic, and yesI told him he should put down the phone and get back to class," Duquette said."I told your kid to get back to school because I believe that is where he shouldbe - he should paying attention in class."Duquette's Twitter account is not connected to the school district, nor to thePalmyra area, he said.Duquette did not resign, and Christopher Connell, the board president, announcedto the audience that the board had no way of reprimanding or removing Duquettefrom the board as some had asked the board to do.Earlier in the meeting, Duquette announced that he had filed a Title IXcomplaint with the Pennsylvania Board of Education's Office of Civil Rights(OCR), and he felt that may have played a role in his social media habitsbecoming a topic."I can't discount this as retaliation," he said. "But I do realize that, as aDemocrat, I snuck onto the school board three years ago. I have questioned them.I have challenged them. I have annoyed them."Duquette told the board in June that he had contacted the OCR regarding Title IXdeficiencies in the school district, but he didn't move forward with a complaintuntil September he said.Title IX protects people from discrimination based on sex in education programsor activities that receive federal financial assistance. Some key areas thatTitle IX covers include recruitment, admissions and counseling; financialassistance; athletics; sex-based harassment; treatment of pregnant and parentingstudents; discipline; single-sex education; and employment, according to theU.S. Department of Education website."I'm not asking for any personal identifying information of students involved insexual assault case, or anything like that," Duquette said in an interviewbefore the board meeting. "What I want the district to do - are they doing thethings that they are supposed to do."He pointed at deficiencies in the school district's Title IX compliance withregard to some basic information being made available to the public such as thename and contact information of the Title IX coordinator, which are currentlyleft blank on the school's official documents.However the school district website does have that information available under atopic list of who to call.
