WASHINGTON - President-elect Donald Trump is tapping a trio of nominees withdeep ties to Washington and Wall Street to fill out his Cabinet, includingformer Goldman Sachs executive Steven Mnuchin as treasury secretary.On Tuesday, Trump also chose Georgia Rep. Tom Price to oversee the nation'shealth care system, picking a fierce "Obamacare" critic who has championedefforts to privatize Medicare. And he selected another veteran Republican,Elaine Chao, to lead the Department of Transportation.Mnuchin's official announcement was expected as early as today, according to aperson familiar with the decision who insisted on anonymity to confirm the pickahead of time.Mnuchin, 53, led Trump's finance operations during the presidential campaign andbecame close with the president-elect and his family. But he has no governmentexperience, which could prove a hurdle in navigating the tricky politics ofWashington.Price, picked to lead the Department of Health and Human Services after morethan a decade in Congress, helped craft House Speaker Paul Ryan's plan toprivatize Medicare, a position Trump opposed in the campaign. Chao, who was thefirst Asian-American woman to serve in a president's Cabinet - she served underGeorge W. Bush - is married to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.The selections came as Trump spent Tuesday with advisers in his Manhattanskyscraper, racing through meetings with prospective administration hires ashigh-profile vacancies loom - none bigger than secretary of State. FormerMassachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, on the shortlist for the nation's chiefdiplomat, was to have a private dinner with the incoming president.Meanwhile, Price's selection raised questions about the incoming president'scommitment to Medicare, among other popular entitlement programs he repeatedlyvowed to preserve before the election. The Georgia congressman led GOP effortson Capitol Hill to transform Medicare into a voucher-like system, a change thatif enacted, likely would dramatically reduce government spending on the healthcare program that serves an estimated 57 million people.
