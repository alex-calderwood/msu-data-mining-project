WASHINGTON - No one listened to Tom Vilsack.As agriculture secretary during the entire Obama administration, the former Iowagovernor has for years been telling anyone who will pay attention - farmers,members of Congress, even Hillary Clinton - that Democrats need a better messagefor rural America. And he's spent most of his tenure focusing on ruraldevelopment, trying to revitalize areas that ultimately voted for RepublicanDonald Trump in this year's presidential election."The Democratic Party, in my opinion, has not made as much of an effort as itought to to speak to rural voters," Vilsack said Tuesday in an interview withThe Associated Press. "What's frustrating to me is that we actually havesomething we can say to them, and we have chosen, for whatever reason, not tosay it."Vilsack is a longtime friend of Bill and Hillary Clinton and was close tobecoming Hillary Clinton's vice presidential running mate. She chose VirginiaSen. Tim Kaine instead. Clinton ultimately won Virginia but lost, deeply, inmany rural areas of the country.He says he understands why party leaders chose a different path to try forelectoral victory, focusing on expanding populations like Hispanics andAfrican-Americans who had come out in large numbers to vote for Barack Obama,the nation's first black president, in 2008 and 2012.The problem, he said, is those groups represent around the same percentage ofthe population as rural voters. And he says Democrats didn't have enough of acounter argument to powerful Republican themes of less regulation and lowertaxes."There wasn't an overarching theme that a person in a small town could go, 'Oh,they're talking about me,'" Vilsack said.According to exit polls, about 17 percent of voters in this year's election werefrom small cities or rural areas, and 62 percent of them said they voted forTrump.
