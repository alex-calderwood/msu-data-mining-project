NEW YORK - A group of election lawyers and data experts have asked HillaryClinton's campaign to call for a recount of the vote totals in threebattleground states - Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania - to ensure that acyberattack was not committed to manipulate the totals.There is no evidence that the results were hacked or that electronic votingmachines were compromised. The Clinton campaign on Wednesday did not respond toa request for comment as to whether it would petition for a recount before thethree states' fast-approaching deadlines to ask for one.President-elect Donald Trump won Wisconsin and Pennsylvania by razor-thinmargins and has a small lead in Michigan. All three had been reliably Democraticin recent presidential elections.The group, led by voting-rights attorney John Bonifaz and J. Alex Halderman, thedirector of the University of Michigan Center for Computer Security and Society,contacted the Clinton campaign this week. That call, which was first reported byNew York Magazine, raised the possibility that Clinton might have received fewervotes than expected in some counties that rely on electronic voting machines.But Halderman, in an article posted on Medium on Wednesday, emphasized that thegroup has no evidence of a cyberattack or voting irregularities. He urged that arecount be ordered just to eliminate the possibility."The only way to know whether a cyberattack changed the result is to closelyexamine the available physical evidence - paper ballots and voting equipment incritical states like Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania," Halderman wrote.Recounts, which are often costly and time-intensive efforts, would likely onlybe initiated if the Clinton camp pushed for one, though Wisconsin independentlyannounced that it would conduct an audit of its vote. A call for a recount,coming on the heels of a sharply partisan election, would likely be cheered byDemocrats but denounced by Republicans.A request to the Trump transition team for comment was not immediately returned.Trump's campaign had long believed that his message of economic populism wouldresonate in the Rust Belt. He frequently campaigned in Pennsylvania and made alate push in both Wisconsin and Michigan, successfully turning out whiteworking-class voters whom pollsters may have missed.Many pre-election polls showed Clinton with slight leads. While advocating forthe recounts, Halderman writes that "the most likely explanation" for Trump'ssurprise win "is that the polls were systematically wrong."The deadlines for petitioning for a recount in all three states are in thecoming days, with Wisconsin's on Friday.
