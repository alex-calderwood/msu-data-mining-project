INDIANAPOLIS - Lawyers for Indiana Governor and Republican Vice President-electMike Pence argued in court Monday that the state's judicial branch has noauthority to require him to comply with Indiana's public records law.The civil case before Indiana's Court of Appeals was brought by Indianapolisattorney William Groth, who sued in 2015 after the Pence administration denied arequest for un-redacted records, including a document related to Republicanefforts to stop President Barack Obama's immigration executive order.Pence has long presented himself as a champion of a free press and the FirstAmendment. That's a contrast to President-elect Donald Trump who made attacks onreporters a hallmark of his campaign and refused to release his tax records asother modern presidential candidates have done.In March, Pence vetoed a bill that would have exempted private universities fromreleasing some police records, calling it "a disservice to the public and anunnecessary barrier to transparency." And on the campaign trail he aggressivelycriticized Democrat Hillary Clinton for refusing to release emails sent from aprivate server she maintained while secretary of state.But his gubernatorial administration has argued against the public release ofemails and other documents that could shed light on his tenure as governor. Insome cases, his office has withheld documents, delayed responses or flatlydenied public records requests filed by The Associated Press and other newsorganizations.On Monday, Pence attorney Joseph Chapelle told the judges that the separation ofpowers established under the state's constitution should prevent the courtsystem from forcing Pence and his immediate staff to comply with the openrecords law if they are sued."Inquiry into the personal papers of the governor would (interfere) with theaffairs of the governor's office," Chapelle said. "He's different than otherstate agencies."The appellate court took up the case after a lower court ruled that Pence didnot have to turn over emails, billing invoices or a document authored by thechief-of-staff to now-Texas Gov. Greg Abbott. The documents, sought by Groth,outlined legal arguments for the GOP's successful challenge to Obama'simmigration executive order.
