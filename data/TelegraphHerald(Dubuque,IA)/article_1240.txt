NEW YORK - This holiday season, elves and "joy" may be on the way out and"peace" and "hope" on the way in. A divisive election that left half the countrydeflated and the other half rejuvenated could reverberate through the holidayshopping season in the gifts people give or how they spend.Some retailers say they have seen a surge in feel-good items such as spatreatments, candles and comfort food, while executives at some major retailerslike Wal-Mart, Target and Macy's have said there's no obvious shift in consumerbehavior since the presidential election won by Republican Donald Trump.The divide in the outlook might reflect the rift in the election, as Americanssplit along geographic lines as well as by income."I don't need a comfort dog. I don't need anybody to feel sorry for me," saidRhondi Bleeker, 50, of Totowa, N.J. "I'm actually happy because I was forTrump."Bleeker, who owns an eyelash extension business, believes the economy will bebetter now. She says she still will be spending the same $3,000 as she doesevery holiday season, but she believes her business could do even better becausewhether people are sad or happy, most will want retail therapy.Some shoppers say they plan to divert money from traditional gifts like sweatersto donations to charity groups in their friends' or relatives' names.Ryan Holmes, of Chicago, who voted for Democrat Hillary Clinton, said he plansto devote at least one-quarter of the $750 he typically spends on holiday giftsto doing that. Even for gifts like music or books, he says he can't help butfeel he might make a political statement such as perhaps giving a book onclimate change to educate a friend."I am frightened to what's to come, and sad and less hopeful," said Holmes, 34,an urban planning and real estate consultant. But he added, "I'm feeling moreengaged."The divide could play into the hands of retailers who customize goods to caterto increasingly fragmented tastes."While some people might drive an election boost, there are going to be othersthat will hold back," said Frank Badillo, director of research at consumerresearch group MacroSavvy LLC. "The winners and losers are going to be dividedby category, by store, by different parts of the country."Products that bear words like "hope" and "kindness" are seeing sales as much asdouble since the election, says Lee Rhodes, founder and CEO of the nine-storeGlassybaby chain that sells handblown glass items. Those with themes like "elf"and "joy" have not kept pace, she said.
