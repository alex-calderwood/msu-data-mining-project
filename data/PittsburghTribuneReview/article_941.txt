Electoral College in perspectiveSince the election victory of Donald Trump, there has been renewed interest anddiscussion about the Electoral College. Here's a simple analogy that can put theElectoral College in perspective.Think of it as the World Series. It takes four wins in a seven-game series toclaim the title. Each game is a new slate. Your team can lose the first game10-1 and win each of the next four by a 1-0 score. Guess what? Your team earnsthe title by winning four games despite being outscored 10-5 throughout theseries.Now think of the presidential election. Instead of a four-game World Series, wehave a 538-game series. The first to get to 270 (one more than half) is thewinner. It doesn't matter if a candidate wins California by 100 votes or 5million votes. You win the state; you get 55 of the 270 needed to win theseries. Consider the recent election results. Trump won more games (32 states),while Hillary Clinton scored more runs (projected to be about a million more).Therefore, Trump wins the series.After all, we are the United States of America. Not the United Individuals ofAmerica.Tim WaltersWhite Oak
