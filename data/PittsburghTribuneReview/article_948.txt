Renowned physicist Stephen Hawking has confirmed what I have been saying tofriends, family and students for years: We must look to the universe for ways topreserve our heritage and the human race.Â Hawking estimates that we haveapproximately 1,000 years to migrate to another planet in our solar systembefore the Earth is no longer habitable.It is truly sad that since John F. Kennedy, no president, or presidentialcandidate for that matter, has placed a high priority on space exploration.Â Notonce did panelists put forth questions to candidates in this campaign's debatesor past debates about space exploration and specifically if they had a plan tosave our civilization when our Earth spins out of existence.We are so intent on protecting that which we have built and those who will carryon our heritage, yet we seem to be so very shortsighted by not placing moreemphasis on space exploration, the only gateway to the survival of life as itnow exists on Earth.Â If we continue to ignore the inevitable destruction of theEarth, those we love and all we have built will perish, and there will be notrace that we ever existed.Matt DrozdRossThe writer, a Republican, is a former Allegheny County Council member.
