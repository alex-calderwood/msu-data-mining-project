No one was more surprised by the results of the presidential election earlierthis month than I was. But, when I thought about it the past few weeks, none ofus should have been surprised.For voters to have returned the Democrats to the White House, they would havehad to say, in effect, it is OK that the president and his surrogates brazenlylied to us about keeping our doctors and health insurance plans and reducingpremiums by $2,500 per family under Obamacare; it is OK that the Democraticcandidate for president, Hillary Clinton, repeatedly lied to us about herprivate email server, the handling of classified documents and the ClintonFoundation money laundering operation; it is OK for the attorney general to havehad a private meeting with the candidate's husband before the decision not toprosecute her was announced. After all, some people are above the law, while therest of us must abide by it or face jail time.In effect, for Ms. Clinton to have won, the American people would have had tosay that the Democrats may continue to dupe and make fools of us, because we arenot smart enough to know any better. The national Democratic Party has swung sofar to the left under Mr. Obama and has had so little regard for the truth thatthe average Joe or Jane could no longer sit by and do nothing. Their onlyrecourse against the arrogance and duplicity of those in power was to beat themat the ballot box.Ms. Clinton may have won the popular vote - due to the ultra-liberal votingblocks on the left coast, in Illinois and in the Northeast - but the rest of thecountry declared with one loud voice, "Enough is enough."SANDY LANNIS GENTILESquirrel Hill
