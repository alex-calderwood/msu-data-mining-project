Retired Marine Gen. James Mattis, a decorated war-time commander considered adeity by many troops and veterans, is on the short-list to run the Pentagon inthe Trump administration, according to media reports.Mattis is meeting with President-Elect Donald Trump on Saturday, the AssociatedPress is reporting. Bloomberg reported Friday that Trump is looking at Mattisand retired Army Gen. Jack Keane as possible nominees for defense secretary.If nominated, Mattis would need a waiver from Congress to become defensesecretary because he has not been out of uniform for seven years, per Title 10of the U.S. Code.It is possible Mattis is meeting with Trump to offer advice onwho Trump should pick as defense secretary.Mattis could not be immediately reached for comment on Friday. He spent 44 yearsin the Marine Corps and retired in 2013 after leading U.S. Central Command.For service members, having Mattis serve as defense secretary could be aconsolation prize of sorts. In a Military Times survey earlier this year, morethan half of the 948 troops surveyed said they believed Mattis running forpresident would be a positive development.But despite efforts this spring by disaffected Republicans to get him to run asa third party candidate, Mattis opted to stay out of the presidential race.Now a fellow at the Hoover Institution in California, Mattis has launched aresearch project into how Americans view the military and he has spoken outabout how little civilians understand about what the military does.In September, he told Military Times that he is particularly concerned aboutcivilian policy-makers making changes to the military to advance socialpolicies."We are liable to find ourselves paying the cost on a battlefield that we do notwant to pay," Mattis said, adding, "We have to be very careful that we do notundercut the military battlefield effectiveness with shortsighted socialprograms."
