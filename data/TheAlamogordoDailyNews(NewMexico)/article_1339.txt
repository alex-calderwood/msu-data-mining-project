As Abe Lincoln used to say: "Don't believe everything you read on Facebook."It's an old joke worth remembering as people dissect what's being calledAmerica's first social media election.Disturbing trends emerged: Fake news, dark posts aimed at suppressing voterturnout and troll attacks.There's an ongoing debate over the actual impact of social media on the electionand on turnout. But there's no question that Americans don't fully understandthe power of social media.Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is facing hard questions and offering to do more toguard against fake news that makes money off the gullibility of Facebook users.But the bottom line has to be the user: "Let the reader beware" should beeveryone's mantra.Being a discerning consumer of information matters regardless of where you getyour news. A good journalist will tell you a single source is not enough.Elections are about politics, but some of the fake news spread on Facebook wasmore about money.BuzzFeed News identified at least 140 sites pumping out fake political newsabout the U.S. presidential race from one town in Macedonia.The sites used Facebook to spread fake stories and generate traffic to theirwebsites, which translated into marketing revenue.Pro-Trump stories were better clickbait, so that was the focus.The sites had all-American sounding names like WorldPoliticus.com,TrumpVision365.com, USConservativeToday.com, DonaldTrumpNews.co, andUSADailyPolitics.com."I started the site for an easy way to make money," a 17-year-old who runs asite with four other people told BuzzFeed. Their site, calledDailynewspolitic.com, is no longer functioning.The false story that the pope endorsed Donald Trump and the false claim thatMike Pence said Michelle Obama is the "most vulgar first lady we've ever had,"were both from Macedonian sites.Each generated a huge volume of shares and reactions on Facebook.This made money for those apolitical teens in Macedonia. But it also may haveswayed Americans.According to the Pew Research Center: "Overall, 20 percent of social media userssay they've modified their stance on a social or political issue because ofmaterial they saw on social media, and 17 percent say social media has helped tochange their views about a specific political candidate."That matters, too, when it comes to the use of "dark posts." These posts usepsychological profiles of Facebook users, which gleaned through preferences,habits and those ubiquitous "quizzes" that tell you things like which Beatle youwould be.Maintaining the integrity of this country's election process requires theAmerican people to show a healthy skepticism, double-check facts and rememberthe profit motive behind those "free" social media services.- The Arizona Republic
