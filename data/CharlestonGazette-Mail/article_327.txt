WASHINGTON - The House easily approved a sweeping biomedical bill Wednesday thatwould help drug and medical device companies win swifter government approval oftheir products, boost disease research and drug-abuse spending and revampfederal mental health programs.The compromise, which envisions spending $6.3 billion over the next decade, wascondemned by consumer groups and some Democrats as a present to drugmakers thatpromised only paltry spending increases for underfunded federal programs.But their objections were overwhelmed by an alliance among Republicans, manyDemocrats and the White House for a 996-page measure that bore wins for bothparties. The Senate's expected final approval next week would mark an uncommonepisode of cooperation between the GOP-run 114th Congress - which plans toadjourn next week - and President Barack Obama in their dwindling days inoffice.The vote was 392-26."We are on the cusp of something special, a once-in-a-generation opportunity totransform how we treat disease, said Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich., chairman of theHouse Energy and Commerce Committee and an author of the legislation.Not everyone agreed.Rep. Rose DeLauro, D-Conn., said that while the bill contained "noble goals thatI share, its relaxation of some standards for federal drug approvals wasdangerous and "neglects the very people clinical trials are meant to help, thatis the patients.No. 2 Senate Democratic leader Richard Durbin of Illinois said he was "totallyunderwhelmed by the bill's extra money, and said its cuts in a diseaseprevention fund created under Obama's health care law to finance new medicalresearch displayed "a warped sense of justice.But Democratic hopes - and leverage - for winning more money and consumerprotections faded with Republican Donald Trump's presidential election triumph.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., flatly said his chamber will sendthe measure to Obama, and Durbin said he expected Senate passage.In a written statement, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said the bill "is notperfect but contains "advances in health that far outweigh these concerns. Hesaid the Senate should approve it quickly.The bill includes an additional $4.8 billion over the next 10 years for theNational Institutes of Health. The medical research agency spends around $32billion annually, and supporters complain that spending cuts imposed by Congressand rising research costs mean its budget has eroded in value since the early2000s."A couple billion dollars doesn't go very far in cancer research over 10 years,said Lisa Plymate, a director of the liberal-leaning National PhysiciansAlliance.Much of the NIH money would be for Obama's precision medicine initiative, aimedat tailoring drugs for people's genes and lifestyles, and research on cancer, afocus of Vice President Joe Biden, whose son Beau died of the disease in 2015.The bill would also sharpen the federal focus on mental health efforts, such ascreating new posts for government officials who would coordinate suchinitiatives. But it has little new money for those programs."We didn't get everything we needed, said Rep. Tim Murphy, R-Pa., sponsor ofthose provisions. "We'll keep pushing that.The measure included funds and an accelerated Food and Drug Administrationapproval process for techniques aimed at regenerating cells. McConnell hassupported those provisions, but critics have condemned the treatments asineffective.The Food and Drug Administration would get $500 million to streamline approvalprocesses for drugs and medical devices. States would get $1 billion over thenext two years for preventing and treating abuse of addictive drugs likeopioids, a problem that is surging in GOP and Democratic represented communitiesaround the country.Among those who've said they oppose the bill are two of the Senate's best-knownpopulist figures, Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.They say it's a giveaway to drug companies."The No. 1 thing we can do right now is to make sure we're dedicating resourcesto expand access to treatment all across the country, Michael Botticelli,director of the White House's Office of National Drug Control Policy, said in aconference call with reporters.Democrats and consumer groups were upset with the bill's streamlining of someFood and Drug Administration processes, including making it easier for companiesto win approval for some antibiotic drugs, some medical devices consideredbreakthroughs and for fresh uses of some existing medicines.Rep. Frank Pallone of New Jersey, top Democrat on the Energy and Commerce panel,acknowledged Democrats' complaints that it would take future legislation toactually provide the money the bill promises. He said he would pressureRepublicans to approve the funds and said of the overall measure, "The benefitsoutweigh my concerns.The bill was backed by scores of patient groups and industry organizationsincluding PhRMA, representing leading pharmaceutical firms and AdvaMed, thetrade association for device makers.Among those who've said they oppose the bill are two of the Senate's best-knownpopulist figures, Sens.
