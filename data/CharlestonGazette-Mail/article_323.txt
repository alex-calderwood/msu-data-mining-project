NEW YORK - You might have thought about it, heard it. A lot. You might have evenfelt it: Dictionary.com's word of the year is "xenophobia."While it's difficult to get at exactly why people look up words in dictionaries,online or on paper, it's clear that in contentious 2016, fear of "othernessbruised the collective consciousness around the globe.The Brexit vote, police violence against people of color, Syria's refugeecrisis, transsexual rights and the U.S. presidential race were among prominentdevelopments that drove debate - and spikes in lookups of the word, said JaneSolomon, one of the dictionary site's lexicographers.The 21-year-old site defines xenophobia as "fear or hatred of foreigners, peoplefrom different cultures, or strangers. And it plans to expand its entry toinclude fear or dislike of "customs, dress and cultures of people withbackgrounds different from our own, Solomon said in a recent interview.The word didn't enter the English language until the late 1800s, she said. Itsroots are in two Greek words - "xenos, meaning "stranger or guest, and "phobos,meaning "fear or panic, Solomon added.The interest was clear June 24, within a period that represents the largestspike in lookups of xenophobia so far this year. That was the day of Brexit,when the UK voted to leave the European Union.Searches for xenophobia on the site increased by 938 percent from June 22 toJune 24, Solomon said. Lookups spiked again that month after President Obama'sJune 29 speech in which he insisted that Donald Trump's campaign rhetoric wasnot a measure of "populism, but rather "nativism, or xenophobia, or worse.Solomon added that chatter about xenophobia goes well beyond the spikes."It has been significant throughout the year, she said. "But after the EUreferendum, hundreds and hundreds of users were looking up the term every hour.Robert Reich, who served in the administrations of Presidents Gerald Ford andJimmy Carter and was President Clinton's labor secretary, felt so strongly aboutxenophobia's prominence today that he appears in a video for Dictionary.comdiscussing its ramifications."I don't think most people even know what xenophobia is, Reich, who teachespublic policy at the University of California, Berkeley, said in an interview."It's a word not to be celebrated but to be deeply concerned about.Solomon's site, based in Oakland, California, started choosing a word of theyear in 2010, based on search data and agreement of in-house experts thatinclude a broad swath of the company, from lexicographers to the marketing andproduct teams to the CEO, Liz McMillan.The word and the sentiment reflect a broader mournful tone to 2016, with Oxforddictionary editors choosing "post-truth as their word of the year, oftendescribed in terms of politics as belonging to a time in which truth has becomeirrelevant."I wish, Solomon said, "we could have chosen a word like unicorns.
