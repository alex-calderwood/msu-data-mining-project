Dow 19,000. Going once, going twice, gone! Do I hear Dow 20,000?Seth Masters, chief investment officer at Bernstein Private Wealth Managementwho boldly predicted Dow 20,000 by 2022  in 2012 when the Dow Jones industrialaverage traded around 13,000 in early June, says the Dow can eclipse 20,000earlier than he originally predicted."I don't know the precise date, but we will be ahead of schedule," Masters toldUSA TODAY in an interview Monday, adding the iconic blue chip stock gauge couldhurdle the 20,000 milestone as early as next year. "2017? Of course it couldhappen in 2017."The Dow traded above 19,000 for the first time Tuesday and closed up 67 pointsto close at a record of 19,023.87.Traveling from Dow 19,000 to Dow 20,000 is not that long of a journey, ifmeasured in stock market miles, as each additional 1,000-point increment equatesto an increasingly smaller percentage change. A 1,000-point move to 20,000, forexample, equates to a gain of just 5.3%. In contrast, the Dow had to double invalue from its first close above 1,000 in November 1972 to its maiden voyageabove 2,000 in January 1987, according to data compiled by S&P Dow JonesIndices. Similarly, the Dow's jump from 10,000 to 11,000 in spring 1999 marked amore sizable 10% gain.The latest Dow breakout has been dubbed the "Trump Rally." After Donald Trump'ssurprise win in the Nov. 8 presidential election, Wall Street has been pricingin stronger economic growth and higher corporate profits in the future, due inlarge part to Trump's more business-friendly and "America First" economicpolicies.Investors are betting if the Trump administration, with the help of aRepublican-controlled Congress, follows through on its promises of lower taxes,fewer regulations on businesses, negotiating better trade deals and spendinghundreds of billions of dollars to fix the nation's aging infrastructure, itwill jump-start growth -- and provide fresh life for the  bull market, which iscoming up on its eighth birthday in March."Trump's election has unleashed 'animal spirits' that (British economist) JohnMaynard Keynes talked about," says Nick Sargen, senior investment strategist atFort Washington Investment Advisors."Investors are hoping his policies ... will boost growth and corporate profits."That big, bullish bet has sparked a rush of investment dollars back into theU.S.  market. The new case for stocks has powered the Dow to a 3.4% gain sinceElection Day and enabled it to take out the 19,000 milestone, nearly two yearsafter it  crossed the 18,000 threshold Dec. 23, 2014.Still, Sargen counters there are headwinds on the horizon."For the time being, investors are ignoring the spikes in bond yields (the10-year Treasury note is above 2.3% for the first time in a year) and the dollar(up 10 of the past 11 sessions), which should have a dampening effect on therally at some point," says Sargen, adding a market scare related toTrump-inspired protectionism could also hurt the bullish vibe.In 2012, when  Masters shocked the world with his provocative Dow 20,000 call,investors -- still spooked by the financial devastation of the Great Recessionand worst stock market decline since the Great Depression -- were in a defensiveshell. They were shifting their money out of stocks into safer investments suchas cash and bonds. In contrast, Masters at the time was bullish on stocks due tothe bearish investor sentiment and his view that earnings and the economy wouldgrow at a decent clip. He also argued that stocks weren't expensive when recordlow bond yields were taken into account."Investors were very, very pessimistic  then," Masters recalls. "The idea thatthe Dow could get to 20,000 seemed far-fetched."Today, investor sentiment has brightened. And with Corporate America continuingto buy back large helpings of its own stock, Masters sees corporate earningsgrowth coming in at a pace of 4.5% to 5%. "In that kind of environment, in thenext few years you will see mid- to single-digit returns for stocks, so within afew years you get to Dow 20,000."So if the Dow hits 20,000 soon,  before Masters' 2022 prediction, will the Dowbe a buy or a sell? It depends on the reason the Dow is breaking out, Mastersargues."If we get to Dow 20,000 because sentiment gets hugely optimistic andprice-to-earnings ratios (or the market's valuation level) rise a lot, I wouldbe worried," Masters says. "If we get there because corporate earnings aregrinding higher I would be happy and would be telling people to stay the courseand remain invested in the Dow."
