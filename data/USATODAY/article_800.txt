While conducting an unusually public search for secretary of State,President-elect Donald Trump again threatened Monday to terminate emergingdiplomatic relations with Cuba if it does not somehow reform."If Cuba is unwilling to make a better deal for the Cuban people, theCuban/American people and the U.S. as a whole, I will terminate deal," Trumptweeted two days after the death of former Cuba leader Fidel Castro.Interviews at Trump Tower on Monday included one with retired general and ex-CIAdirector David Petraeus, a potential pick in the  battle for secretary of State.On Tuesday, Trump is scheduled to meet with another State Departmentpossibility, Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee, chairman of the Senate ForeignRelations Committee. The president-elect also has a second interview lined upfor 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, whose possible appointmentas secretary of State has drawn criticism from Trump backers."It's going to be a busy week," Vice President-elect and transition chairmanMike Pence told reporters in the lobby of Trump Tower en route to meetings. "Getready. Buckle up."Petraeus told reporters that he and Trump spoke for about an hour, and thepresident-elect "showed a great grasp of a variety of the challenges that areout there, and some of the opportunities as well."Calling it a "very good conversation," Petraeus said that "we'll see where itgoes from here."One challenge is Cuba.The Obama administration has engaged in a series of diplomatic moves with theCuban regime, from agreeing to commercial flights to the opening of embassyoffices in each nation's capital.Trump, who made a similar claim regarding Cuba during the presidential campaign,has not specified how he might roll back these initiatives.The president-elect's latest moves came a day after he used Twitter to expoundconspiracy theories about alleged voter fraud, suggesting that is the reason helost to Democrat Hillary Clinton by more than 2 million votes in the latesttallies.After a series of tweets criticizing Clinton and aides for participating in avote recount in Wisconsin, Trump said in another post: "In addition to winningthe Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct themillions of people who voted illegally."He provided no evidence for that assertion, popular among conspiracy theorists.Trump also claimed voter fraud in the states of Virginia, New Hampshire, andCalifornia, again without evidence.Tom Rath, a veteran Republican from New Hampshire (and a supporter of Ohio Gov.John Kasich during the Republican primaries) responded to Trump on Twitter:"This will probably cost me my spot in the Cabinet but there was no fraud,serious or other, in this election in NH. There just wasn't."And a researcher who said the Trump campaign is citing one of his reports saidit included nothing about voter fraud."We found millions of out-of-date registration records due to people moving ordying, but found no evidence that voter fraud resulted," tweeted David Becker,executive director of The Center for Election Innovation & Research.Clinton officials and Democrats mocked Trump's complaints."We are getting attacked for participating in a recount that we didn't ask forby the man who won election but thinks there was massive fraud," said a tweetfrom Clinton campaign general counsel Marc Elias.
