In a sign of plans to roll back President Obama's health care law,President-elect Donald Trump plans to nominate Georgia congressman and outspokenObama critic Tom Price to be secretary of Health and Human Services, officialssaid.Ex-House speaker Newt Gingrich, a frequent Trump adviser, tweeted that Pricewill make a "great" HHS secretary, and "is the right leader to help Congressreplace Obamacare."A transition official confirmed the planned nomination, speaking on condition ofanonymity until the announcement is made official, perhaps on Tuesday.Price, who serves as chairman of the House budget committee, is an orthopedicsurgeon, policy wonk and a staunch opponent of Obamacare who could prove crucialin Trump's efforts to dismantle the Affordable Care Act if confirmed.Vice President-elect Mike Pence, who is leading Trump's transition team, toldreporters Monday night to expect "a number of very important announcementstomorrow." He didn't elaborate.While conducting an unusually public search for secretary of State, Trump againthreatened Monday to terminate emerging diplomatic relations with Cuba if itdoes not somehow reform."If Cuba is unwilling to make a better deal for the Cuban people, theCuban/American people and the U.S. as a whole, I will terminate deal," Trumptweeted two days after the death of former Cuba leader Fidel Castro.Interviews at Trump Tower on Monday included one with retired general and ex-CIAdirector David Petraeus, a potential pick in the  battle for secretary of State.On Tuesday, Trump is scheduled to meet with another State Departmentpossibility, Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee, chairman of the Senate ForeignRelations Committee. The president-elect also has a second interview lined upfor 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, whose possible appointmentas secretary of State has drawn criticism from Trump backers."It's going to be a busy week," Pence told reporters in the lobby of Trump Toweren route to meetings. "Get ready. Buckle up."Petraeus told reporters that he and Trump spoke for about an hour, and thepresident-elect "showed a great grasp of a variety of the challenges that areout there, and some of the opportunities as well."Calling it a "very good conversation," Petraeus said that "we'll see where itgoes from here."One challenge is Cuba.The Obama administration has engaged in a series of diplomatic moves with theCuban regime, from agreeing to commercial flights to the opening of embassyoffices in each nation's capital.Trump, who made a similar claim regarding Cuba during the presidential campaign,has not specified how he might roll back these initiatives.The president-elect's latest moves came a day after he used Twitter to expoundconspiracy theories about alleged voter fraud, suggesting that is the reason helost to Democrat Hillary Clinton by more than 2 million votes in the latesttallies.After a series of tweets criticizing Clinton and aides for participating in avote recount in Wisconsin, Trump said in another post: "In addition to winningthe Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct themillions of people who voted illegally."He provided no evidence for that assertion, popular among conspiracy theorists.Trump also claimed voter fraud in the states of Virginia, New Hampshire, andCalifornia, again without evidence.Solis reported from Washington
