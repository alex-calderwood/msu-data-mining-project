During his campaign for the White House, President-elect Donald Trump promisedto eliminate regulations that target coal-fired power plants, one of the primarycauses of carbon emissions responsible for climate change.For Trump, a climate-change skeptic, getting rid of the Obama administration'sClean Power Plan, which would curb carbon emissions from power plants by 32% by2030, would give a boost to the declining U.S. coal industry and its decimatedworkforce across Appalachia.Even if the next president were to succeed, he would probably not reverse ayears-long movement away from coal in the U.S. electric power industry, thebiggest consumer of the black rock, according to the head of one of the nation'sleading electric utilities."If he were able to do that, I don't know really how much impact it would havebecause we're moving ahead and rebalancing our portfolio," Nick Akins, thepresident and CEO of American Electric Power, said recently."I think it's going to be very difficult for new coal-fired generation to getdeveloped," he said.Obama-era policies requiring reductions in emissions of carbon, mercury andother pollutants have contributed to coal's loss of market share in the powersector.Even more significant has been record U.S. production of cheap shale gas, thanksto hydraulic fracturing and other technologies, plus the slow but steadypenetration of wind and solar energy into power markets."It's a seven-year construction cycle for a coal unit; 15 years for a nuclearunit," Akins said in a phone call from AEP's Columbus, Ohio, headquarters. "Youcan develop a natural gas plant in two to three years, with a lot less risk forshareholders, and the price of natural gas as a fuel source is stillsubstantially low."And there are areas of the country that benefit from low-cost renewable fuels,particularly wind, and solar continues to come down as well, particularlyutility-scale solar. Those are areas that will continue to develop."For AEP, which has 5.4 million customers in 11 states, coal's share of thecompany's generating capacity has fallen from 71% in 2005 to about 47% in 2017.Over that time, gas capacity has risen from 20% to 27%, and renewable energy hasjumped from 3% to 13%.The switch is happening even faster across the USA, where gas surpasses coal asa fuel for power plants.All told, the U.S. Energy Information Administration expects gas to provide anaverage of 34% of the electricity generated in the USA in 2016, compared with30% for coal.Also figuring heavily in utility investment decisions are changing expectationsamong customers, especially demands for "clean energy" among younger customers."There's no doubt that there's an element of environmental stewardship thatcontinues to be part of the fabric of our investment thesis," Akins said.Trump's bid to reverse Obama environmental policies may provide a reprieve forsome older coal power plants, though gas prices, if they remain low, willprobably cut into those units' operating time, according to the utility chief.At the same time, Trump's bullish support for gas production and pipelineconstruction may exacerbate coal's competitive problems."We'll still have the capacity available, but we won't be using the units asmuch, and you'll see more utilization of natural gas to back up intermittentrenewable energy," Akins said.Trump's commitment to promote new infrastructure may benefit companies such asAEP, whose 40,000-mile electric transmission network is the largest in the USA.AEP spends more than $3 billion a year on transmission improvements, includingprojects designed to bring new renewable and distributed energy to market."There's no question that jobs are being created on the infrastructure side ofthings," he said.As for communities where AEP has shuttered coal power plants, the company workswith economic-development officials in states such as Kentucky and West Virginiato see whether the sites can be marketed for new manufacturing."If the Trump administration really wants to focus on that part of the country,it really ought to think of them like the Go Zones in Louisiana after HurricaneKatrina," Akins said, referring to a law passed by Congress in 2005 thatprovided tax incentives for businesses locating in areas in three statesdevastated by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.
