Presidential candidate Donald Trump loved the raucous political rallies thatmarked his campaign -- loved them so much he's doing them again aspresident-elect.After a pit stop in Indianapolis to tout a new jobs agreement with the Carrierheating and air conditioning company, Trump headed to Cincinnati later Thursdayto open a "Thank You Tour" of swing states that put him over the top in theElectoral College."I am grateful for all of your support," Trump tweeted in promoting the Ohioevent. "THANK YOU!"In what looks like an unprecedented post-election victory lap for apresident-elect, the Trump team is working on events in other big states hecarried last month, including North Carolina, Iowa, Michigan, Pennsylvania, andFlorida.Trump and aides called the tour a chance for him to thank the voters who put himin office, though some analysts questioned whether they are a waste of time thatcould otherwise be devoted to the  task of putting together a presidentialadministration.David Cohen, a political science professor at the University of Akron whospecializes in While House staffing, said he finds it "baffling" he would spendso much time campaigning."There's so much to do when you've been elected president," Cohen said. "Thereare so many jobs to fill."Making his first public appearance since the Nov. 8 election, Trump and VicePresident-elect Mike Pence -- also the governor of Indiana -- stopped Thursdayat a Carrier plant in Indianapolis.After planning to lay off some 1,400 workers and shift some operations toMexico, Carrier has  agreed to keep a plant open and retain around 1,000employees. Details remain hazy, including whether some Carrier employees willstill lose jobs and the nature of the tax breaks the company is getting to stayin Indiana."Companies are not going to leave the United States anymore withoutconsequences," Trump said after touring the Carrier plant, echoing comments hemade on the campaign trail.The Cincinnati stop calls for a victory rally that mirror the ones Trump heldduring the campaign. In Ohio and state after state, the Republican nomineedenounced the political establishment in general and Democratic rival HillaryClinton in particular, while his supporters chanted things like "lock her up!"and shouted epithets at members of the press.Previous presidents-elect also have done campaign-style events, but they tendedto be smaller in scope and took place closer to the Inauguration Day of Jan. 20.In 1993, President-elect Bill Clinton conducted a campaign-style bus tour thattook him from Thomas Jefferson's home at Monticello in Virginia to the LincolnMemorial in Washington. Clinton also did some campaigning shortly after the 1992election, stumping in Georgia during a run-off for a U.S. Senate seat.Just before his inauguration in 2009, President-elect Barack Obama took awhistle-stop train ride from New York City to Washington, including a stop inWilmington, Del., to pick up Vice President-elect Joe Biden.Trump has frequently cited his love of well-attended political rallies, and someanalysts described his thank you tour as the inevitable continuation of acampaign also fueled by social media and 24/7 media.Martha Joynt Kumar, director of the bipartisan White House Transition Project,said Trump has good reason for wanting to be with his people.After days of being "cloistered" in Trump Tower, interviewing job applicants andmaking appointments, she said, "he understandably has a need to go out and getback to what brought him there -- what won him presidency."
