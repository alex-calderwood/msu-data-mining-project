In the state everyone said Donald Trump needed to win, this ultra-wealthycoastal hideaway for some of the nation's business leaders came out strong forthe Republican candidate, producing Florida's highest county voter turnout withthe help of many of the GOP's most traditional and faithful members.Trump's victory wasn't just about gaining the underemployed, angry, rural whitevote. In Naples, one of the wealthiest communities in the country with a medianhousehold income of roughly $80,500, former corporate executives overwhelminglysupported Trump and his calls for cutting government regulations and rebuildingthe country's infrastructure.Francis Rooney, the Naples multimillionaire CEO of Manhattan Construction andprolific GOP donor who was just elected to Congress, said he voted for Trump andsupported his calls to get rid of the Dodd-Frank act, which went into law afterthe Great Recession. The law has been criticized for the regulatory burden ithas put on banks and other business.John Sorey, the ex-CEO of the Spectrum Corp. in Tennessee, said he voted forTrump in the hope that investments in the country's infrastructure will have a"multiple effect" on job creation.Phyllis "Flip" West, a Naples retiree whose family owned a West Virginia weldingcompany, said she voted for Trump because the country "needs to be run as abusiness.""The whole big thing is the economy," West, 78, said. "We need to bring itback."West is one of an outsized population of ex-CEOs and business supervisors inNaples, a retirement town with a population of roughly 20,000 that prides itselfon its annual multimillion dollar wine festival fundraisers and high-end sportscar shows.The area's rich donors and corporate executives, many of whom keep their privatejets at the city's municipal airport, turned out largely for former CEO MittRomney in the 2012 election.But setting aside concerns that traditionally conservative areas might abandonthis year's GOP nominee, Trump's background as a real estate developer andcompany owner helped convince Naples business leaders that he can grow theeconomy."He gets things done," said Sorey, 73, who is also the former mayor of Naples."The most similarity among Naples voters is the fact that they like success andsee success as a positive attribute."Trump is also proposing a major tax cut for wealthy residents like the ones inNaples, including a cut of 6.5% to the country's top 1% of earners, according toan analysis by the Tax Policy Center.Naples business leaders, including some who have donated millions to Republicanpresidential candidates in the past, were split during the GOP Florida primary,with some leaders supporting former Florida  governor Jeb Bush or Florida Sen.Marco Rubio.Rooney, who relocated his Oklahoma company's headquarters to Naples in 2002, hasclose ties to the Bush family. His company built the Texas Rangers baseballstadium in Arlington when George W. Bush was part owner of the team. Rooney wasa top fundraiser for Bush and later served as his ambassador to the Vatican.Rooney said he voted for Jeb Bush in the primary. But once the Republican Partychose Trump as its nominee, Rooney said, he was "all in." He said he supportsTrump's call to repeal or modify the Affordable Care Act, also known asObamacare.John Allen, a real estate executive and major Naples donor whose waterfront homeis valued at more than $12million, said he voted for Rubio in the primary butultimately supported Trump because of his business experience."On the heels of a president that was totally unqualified to be president -- whonever built a job or ran a company, had a payroll or created benefits -- did Ilike the fact that Trump had tremendous success, that he has a background anddid it in New York City and other difficult environments? Yes, I found thatattractive," Allen, 62, said."He understands investment and return and is willing to take risks," Allen said."He's an outspoken advocate of the free enterprise system."The area's less enthusiastic Trump supporters ultimately voted for him largelybecause of the flaws of Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, said KathleenPassidomo, a Naples lawyer and newly elected state senator."So many people I talked to -- not just Republicans, but Democrats andindependents -- were really distressed about Hillary Clinton," said Passidomo,who voiced concerns about Trump after a video surfaced of him talkingdisparagingly about women. "It wasn't just the emails. It was the elitism of theClinton dynasty and her expectation that she deserved the presidency because shewas a Clinton."West, whose family owned a welding company, is a registered Republican, but saidshe flipped parties in West Virginia to vote for a Democratic governor whosupported the steel and coal industry that bought supplies from welders.She said she supported Trump since the beginning of the GOP primary because shebelieves he can "bring trade back to our country." She calls trade the "tailcoatof the economy."Supporters see the possibility of Trump achieving on the national level the samekind of progress Floridians view from Republican Gov. Rick Scott, said MikeLyster, chairman of the Collier County Republican Executive Committee. Scott's2010 gubernatorial campaign, similar to Trump's presidential run, promoted Scottas a businessman who had never held elected office.Trump has said he's not beholden to his campaign donors, which could give himthe "best chance of any of the elected officials in Washington to make good onhis promises" to improve the economy, Passidomo said."That's pretty amazing," she said.
