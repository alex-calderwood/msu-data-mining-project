From buying a failed bank during the U.S. financial crisis to producing majormovies and serving as national finance chairman for Donald Trump's presidentialcampaign, Steven Mnuchin has a record of winning risky bets.Now the former Wall Street banker is poised for what could be his biggestchallenge yet: Trump's nominee for  Treasury secretary.Trump was  likely  to officially name Mnuchin (mi-NOO-chin), 53, as his choicefor the nation's top financial policy job as soon as Wednesday, a source closeto Trump's transition team told USA TODAY on Tuesday. The person spoke oncondition of anonymity because officials were not authorized to speak publiclyabout selections.The news that Mnuchin is Trump's pick came as reports swirled that Trump wouldnominate billionaire Wilbur Ross, also considered a risk taker, to serve asCommerce secretary. Ross, 79, made a career  of buying ailing companies insometimes troubled sectors on the cheap, restructuring them and then sellingthem for billions of dollars. Ross, too, could be announced as early asWednesday, the source close to the transition team said.Trump has praised Mnuchin, who with the Republican National Committee helpedraise tens of millions of dollars for the billionaire businessman's campaign.However, they weren't always the best of friends. Mnuchin did not respond to USATODAY interview requests.In a 2008 lawsuit, Trump targeted one of Mnuchin's companies, alleging DeutscheBank and others improperly balked at extending multimillion-dollar constructionloans on the Trump International Hotel and Tower in Chicago. The case ultimatelywas settled.Mnuchin, a twice-married father of three, is a Yale graduate who followed hisfather to renowned U.S. investment bank Goldman Sachs. He  spent 17 years there,amassing a fortune and becoming an executive vice president of the New YorkCity-based company before his 2003 departure.His next stop was ESL International, the hedge fund founded by Edward Lampert,one of Mnuchin's Yale roommates and another Goldman alumnus who now is the CEOand chairman of Sears Holdings. Lampert tapped him for a board seat on SearsHoldings-owned retail chain Kmart in 2003.  Mnuchin left  to become chiefexecutive of SFM Capital Managment,  backed by financier George Soros.Mnuchin's SFM tenure was similarly brief. In 2004, he co-founded private hedgefund Dune Capital Management with Daniel Neidich, another former Goldmanexecutive. The fund invested in equities and real estate -- including some Trumpprojects.The fund invested in the U.S. movie industry. Starting in 2006, Mnuchin reacheda three-year deal in which Dune Entertainment agreed to invest $500 million in20th Century Fox movies, according to  news media reports.The transaction launched a deeper Mnuchin dive into entertainment investmentsand co-producing that  included the Hollywood blockbusters Avatar and the X-Menfranchise, American Sniper, Gravity and The Lego Movie.In 2013, Mnuchin, filmmaker Brett Ratner and Australian businessman James Packerjoined in an entity called RatPac-Dune Entertainment that agreed to $300 millionin co-financing for as many as 75 films by Warner Bros. Pictures, according tothe movie company and media reports.The following year, Mnuchin partnered with Ryan Kavanaugh and an investmentgroup to buy debt and an equity stake in Kavanaugh's Relativity Media.Five years before taking the Relativity post, he led an investor group thatbought California-based IndyMac Bank, which collapsed  during the financialcrisis.IndyMac became OneWest Bank, with Mnuchin as chairman. The deal drew criticismbecause it was finalized before FDIC Chair Sheila Bair instituted a change thatwould require private equity buyers like the Mnuchin-led group to maintain a 10%leverage ratio at newly resurrected banks and hold the investments for at leastthree years.Criticism and lawsuitsNew criticism -- and lawsuits -- came after Relativity Media sought federalbankruptcy court protection in July 2015. By then, Mnuchin had left the moviecompany's board. And he was weeks away from selling OneWest Bank to CIT Group ata price that produced a hefty profit for him and fellow investors -- $3.4billionin cash and stock, more than doubling their investment.One of Relativity Media's creditors, RKA Film Financing, took a cynical view ofMnuchin's dual involvement with the movie company and the bank -- which was alsoowed millions by Relativity.In a 2016 New York Supreme Court lawsuit, RKA said Relativity's collapse"amounted to a classic Ponzi scheme," and labeled its CEO Kavanaugh "a con man."Mnuchin had held "a unique position," the lawsuit alleged, "affording himknowledge of both Relativity's precarious financial position and the ability toensure certain creditors -- namely OneWest Bank -- were able to siphon awayfunds that had been commingled" with RKA's investments.The lawsuit also charged that OneWest swept approximately $50 million fromRelativity's bank accounts before the collapse.A Mnuchin court filing called his inclusion in RKA's lawsuit "not just baseless,but sanctionable."He moved to throw out the case, as did Kavanaugh. Manhattan Supreme CourtJustice Charles Ramos dismissed the lawsuit in  October.Though Mnuchin is best known publicly for his business dealings, he and hisfamily also became known as some of the thousands of investors caught up in theaftermath of Bernard Madoff's notorious Ponzi scheme.More than $3 million that Mnuchin and his brother inherited from their deceasedmother's estate represented fictitious profits from Madoff's estimated$20billion scam, court-appointed trustee Irving Picard alleged in a 2010bankruptcy court filing.But a court decision said the family's withdrawals, and similar Madoff payoutsto other investors, had occurred more than two years before the schemecollapsed.Contributing: Ray Locker and Paul Davidson
