Coming off a holiday weekend in South Florida, Donald Trump unleashed a Sundaymorning tweet storm on Hillary Clinton over her campaign's decision to join arecount process on voting results in Wisconsin and perhaps other states."So much time and money will be spent -- same result! Sad" Trump said in oneTwitter post.Trump, who spent Thanksgiving weekend at his Mar-A-Lago estate in Palm Beach,Fla., expressed his recount displeasure before his planned return to New YorkCity early Sunday evening.More interviews for jobs in the Trump administration are planned for the comingweek. Among the slots Trump is looking to fill: secretaries of State, Treasury,and Defense.The president-elect's comments about the recount capped a series of tweets inwhich he quoted Clinton's criticism of a Trump debate comment that he might notrecognize the results on the election should he lose.At one point, Trump noted, Clinton described refusal to accept the results of anelection as "a direct threat to our democracy."The Clinton campaign announced Saturday it would participate in a Wisconsinrecount sought by Green Party candidate Jill Stein, and may join Stein-backedefforts in Michigan and Pennsylvania. Officials cited voter concerns aboutRussian hacking and other forms of alleged voting problems.While Clinton officials said they have seen no evidence of vote tampering, anddo not expect the results in any state to change, they believe their campaignneeds to be represented during any recount process.In a post on Medium, Clinton general counsel Marc Erik Elias wrote: "Because wehad not uncovered any actionable evidence of hacking or outside attempts toalter the voting technology, we had not planned to exercise this optionourselves, but now that a recount has been initiated in Wisconsin, we intend toparticipate in order to ensure the process proceeds in a manner that is fair toall sides."While Trump carried the states of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin by atotal of only around 107,000 votes, Elias noted that "the number of votesseparating Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton in the closest of these states --Michigan -- well exceeds the largest margin ever overcome in a recount."Clinton supporters raised concerns about possible Russian hacking of theelection, though the Democratic team and the Obama administration have saidthere is no evidence of it.Trump, meanwhile, charged the Clinton campaign with hypocrisy."Hillary Clinton conceded the election when she called me just prior to thevictory speech and after the results were in," Trump said in one post. "Nothingwill change."Trump made some appointments and worked on other transition issues during histime at Mar-A-Lago, including what aides described as a 45 minute phoneconversation Saturday with President Obama."They've been talking regularly on any number of issues," Trump adviserKellyanne Conway said on NBC's Meet The Press.While Trump enjoys his conversations with Obama and "they get along nicely,"Conway also told NBC that "they disagree on many things. That's not going tochange."During a series of Sunday show interviews, Conway said Trump is also workingwith aides on how to avoid potential conflicts of interests between his actionsas president and the many business interests he and his family have across theworld."He has been talking to his lawyers, he's been talking to ethics compliancefolks," Conway told Meet The Press. "Everything will be done the way it needs tobe done."
