Count local TV station owners among the industries emboldened by Donald Trump.In changing of the guards at the White House, the local TV industry sees a ripeopportunity in their ongoing quest to toss out the Federal CommunicationCommission's rules on media cross-ownership that bar media companies from owningnewspapers and TV stations in the same market.The National Association of Broadcasters, a trade group for TV station owners,"is cautiously optimistic a Trump FCC will take a fresh look at reformingoutdated local broadcast ownership rules," said Dennis Wharton, NAB's executivevice president of media relations. "These are I Love Lucy  era rules in a ModernFamily  world."The rules, devised in the 1975, specifically prohibit media companies to own anewspaper and a TV station in the same local market. Companies are also barredfrom owning more than one top-4-in-ratings TV station in any market.The FCC drafted the rules to prevent heavy concentration of local media marketshares held by one company, asserting that such dominant ownership can inhibitdiversity of opinions and raise prices for advertisers. Media companies havefought for years to loosen or eliminate the rules, arguing that they're outdatedin the digital era and limit business diversification needed to enrich theirrevenues.The FCC, which is directed by five commissioners appointed by the U.S.president, reviews the rules every four years to ensure they're still relevant.After completing the review in August, the agency, in a partisan 3-2 vote, choseto retain the rules for the next four years, but provided an exception for"failed or failing newspapers" to receive investment from a TV business in theirmarket.The prevailing assumption on K Street is that President-elect Donald Trump --even though he has publicly stated his opposition to AT&T's proposed$85.4billion acquisition of Time Warner -- will look to loosen industryregulations.With Republicans expected to take over the FCC's five-member panel, the NABplans to ask the agency to reconsider its latest quadrennial decision. Less thana week after the presidential election, the News Media Alliance, whichrepresents print publishers, also filed an appeal of the FCC's decision.In seeking to revisit the rules, media companies will argue that digitaltechnology, in particular, has completely remade industry dynamics. And relaxingownership restrictions could spark more acquisitions and other investment deals.Ajit Pai, one of the FCC's current commissioners and a Republican who'smentioned as a possible candidate to replace the outgoing FCC chairman TomWheeler, told a gathering of local TV executives in a conference in Wichita lastmonth that "the FCC missed a golden opportunity to update our ownership rules toreflect the modern media marketplace."
