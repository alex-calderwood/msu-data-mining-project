No column sig.

These defections helpedRepublican Donald Trump win the once reliably blue Rust Belt states ofPennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin and ultimately the nation.If the Democrats are going to bounce back in the 2018 mid-term elections,they're going to have to bring these voters back into the tent - it's as simpleas that.If anything, given which Senate seats will be up for election, these blue collarwhite voters will have even more of an impact in 2018 than they did in 2016.In the next cycle, Democrats will be defending senate seats in Florida, Indiana,Michigan, Missouri, Montana, North Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, West Virginia andWisconsin - all states that went for Trump. The Republicans will be defendingonly one Senate seat in a state that Clinton won, Nevada.There's no question the map favors the GOP.The first major decision the Democrats will have to make is who will replace theinterim chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, Donna Brazile.As of now, the favorite appears to be liberal Minnesota Congressman KeithEllison.Ellison, the only Muslim member of Congress, has already racked up somehigh-profile endorsements, including Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, incomingSenate Minority Leader Charles Schumer and filmmaker Michael Moore.However, given Ellison's long history of associating with radicals and makingextreme statements on race and other matters, he may not be the Democrats' bestmessenger to communicate with blue collar America.As a third-year law student at the University of Minnesota, Ellison wrotecolumns for the Minnesota Daily under the name Keith Hakim. In these op-edpieces, Ellison demanded reparations for slavery and an optional separatecountry for American blacks.Ellison organized a rallythat featured Nation of Islam spokesman Khalid AbdulMuhammad. At the rally Muhammad declared, "If words were swords, the chests ofJews, gays and whites would be pierced."Ellison has since tried to distance himself from these off-the-wall statementsand boutique beliefs. However, all indications are that he continued to publiclydefend Louis Farrakhan and the Nation of Islam through at least the year 2000,when he was an elected member of the Minnesota state Legislature.More recently, Ellison made headlines by declaring Cuban dictator Fidel Castro'slegacy to be a "mixed bag."While speaking to Sirius XM's Karen Hunter, Ellison said that while Castroengaged in "harsh dictatorial tactics," he also stood up "for peace and freedomin Africa." Ellison went on to argue, "If you look at his legacy you have to saythat he confronted people with a lot of power on behalf of people that didn'thave any."OK, then. Thanks for clearing that up.Tapping Congressman Ellison as chairman of the DNC may be cathartic forshell-shocked Democrats, but he would be an unmitigated disaster for the party.John Phillips is a CNN political commentator and can be heard weekdays at 3 p.m.on "The Drive Home with Jillian Barberie and John Phillips" on KABC/AM 790.
