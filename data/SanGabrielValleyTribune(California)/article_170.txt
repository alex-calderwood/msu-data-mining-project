Governing, especially at the presidential level isanother. Some know this intuitively. Others learn in a hard school.Both major party presidential candidates this year came out against the complextrade pact called the Trans-Pacific Partnership. They knew that, especially forworkers, and out-of-workers, in America's heartland, free trade with othernations can seem like a fool's bargain. These agreements with low-wage nationsunderstandably look like an unfair deal that end up destroying Americanmanufacturing jobs.It's much easier to say that on the hustings than to go into an eggheadyeconomic analysis about the efficiencies of world markets raising all boats.But the fact of the matter is that Hillary Clinton changed her position on theTPP for strategic reasons after she had supported the trade agreement assecretary of state.And one arm of President-elect Donald Trump's business empire sells clothes madein China and elsewhere in the Far East. He knows better than the rest of us thatslapping a 45 percent tariff on a silk necktie would not make it any easier tosell.Nor would doing so be anything like a bargain for the American consumer. Thoseincredible deals at Walmart on T-shirts, and dress shirts, made in Bangladeshand Colombia are made possible by trade agreements such as NAFTA and TPP, which,by the way, includes thousands of tax cuts for American businesses that wouldmake trade a better two-way street for our country's exporters as well asimporters.The benefits of free trade are one of the key elements of international commerceon which economists on the right, the center and the left all agree. Running thenumbers, it turns out that the best way to increase prosperity in all thenations of the world is to allow each country's economy to do what it does best.Chinese companies manufacture iPhones and clothing more efficiently than we dohere. We're a whole lot better, for instance, at postsecondary education - sixof the top 10 universities in the world are American - and at creatingintellectual property, with eight of the top 10 brands, from Apple to Visa,being American.The incoming president, in a different role than campaigner, will do well tocontinue to fine-tune trade agreements in the American interest rather thancancel them.Protectionism is a misnomer- trade wars protect no one, creating equal andopposite reactions from other countries that would greatly harm American workersand consumers. And the fact is that presidents on their own can only increasetariffs 15 percent, and then only for 150 days, unless a state of emergency isdeclared, an unlikely scenario.One clear way for a new administration to increase the efficiencies free tradecreates is to call out China's blatant cheating on some of the agreements inplace, from its subsidizing the price of rice and wheat to its currencymanipulation to its stealing patented ideas to its hacking into our companies'email systems to its counterfeiting of our brands.Demanding compliance with current and future trade agreements, rather thanbacking away from them or pretending that discredited protectionist policieswould help the average American, is the courageous course the new administrationmust take if it wants to ensure prosperity for our nation.
