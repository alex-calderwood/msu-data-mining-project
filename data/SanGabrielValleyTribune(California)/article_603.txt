The symbolismof Clinton's inauguration as the first women president would have resonatedworld-wide as a mark of the progress that American women have achieved in allwalks of life. Instead, the post-mortem is well underway about why, despite allthe polls and pundit predictions, Clinton lost.Many are pointing to sexism as the main culprit, yet no empirical evidenceexists to back it up. We know that sexist and misogynistic views exist withinour society, and that negative stereotypes about women are constantly promotedwithin our mass media. However, proving a link between sexist views and votingbehavior, with any validity, is impossible. Public opinion polls for years haveshown support for electing a woman president, suggesting that a majority ofAmericans are not deterred by a woman candidate. Partisanship was more thanlikely the deciding factor in 2016 as severe polarization has continued amongthe American electorate, as were economic issues as evidenced by Donald Trump'ssuccess in the Rust Belt.Similarly, gender bias in news coverage is also a popular theory for why Clintonlost. While sexist and misogynistic language exists, particularly online and insocial media, there is no empirical evidence to suggest this can effect voterpreference or turnout. If a blogger or cable news pundit writes or sayssomething offensive about a woman candidate, are we to believe that cantranslate into hundreds of thousands or even millions of voters refusing tosupport her? That assessment defies logic. Obviously, sexism can have a harmfuleffect when considering the broader issue of political socialization through themass media, but we should not overinflate its importance as it relates topolitical news and voting behavior. Not only has research shown thatfrontrunners get more negative coverage (which Clinton was in 2008 and 2016),but also that public criticism of sexist attacks can eliminate the effectivenessand make it seem less credible.Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign built extensively on the support she earnedin her campaign for the Democratic nomination in 2008. She won the Democraticnomination with 34 primary and caucus victories and a total of 17 million votes.She broke every fundraising record with the $500 million she raised thiscampaign cycle (not to mention the nearly $200 million in Super PAC funds). Inthe general election, she won 19 states plus the District of Columbia, 232electoral votes, and will win the popular vote. To say that American voterscan't or won't vote for a woman for president no longer holds credibility.A closer examination of Clinton as a candidate is where we see many compellingreasons for her loss. I am on record that Clinton was an "inherently flawedcandidate," which left me skeptical for years that she could actually win thepresidency. During this campaign, she was under investigation by the FBI forboth her use of a private email server and fundraising at the Clinton Foundationwhile secretary of state. That, along with the baggage from her husband's longpolitical career, reinforced the negative perceptions many Americans have had ofthe Clintons for years.A majority of voters did not trust her, nor did they hold a positive view ofher. What has often helped women politicians - being more trusted among voters,in part, for their outsider perspective - was lost for Clinton. In addition, theargument that she should run on the historic nature of her campaign to be thefirst woman president fell flat months ago, as polling and focus group datasuggested that message was hurting more than helping her.Group solidarity also did not emerge for Clinton with women voters. Despiteprojections that the gender gap would be a record-breaking 20 percent or higher,it was only 13 percent (similar to Barack Obama's support from women in 2008 and2012, as well as Al Gore's in 2000). Political scientists have long known thatwomen are not a monolithic voting bloc. Research continues to show that it ispartisan affiliation (including policy choices), and not gender, that is mostinfluential in determining women's voter preference. Mitt Romney won amongmarried women and white women in 2012; this time, Clinton won among marriedwomen, but 53 percent of white women supported Trump, proving that gender isjust one part of the voting behavior equation.As I have long argued, despite the inevitable symbolism that will come fromelecting the first woman president, nothing will change about our constitutionand/or presidential powers. I concluded in my 2015 book "In It to Win: ElectingMadam President" that a gendered strategy is not necessary for a womanpresidential candidate to win, and I believe the Clinton campaign proved thatpoint. While some gender advantages may exist, it is the institutional,constitutional, nuts-and-bolts of the electoral process that ultimatelydetermines the winner. Despite the advantage in fundraising, politicalexperience and a superior ground game, the Clinton campaign failed to provide astrong narrative about why she should be elected, and failed to turn out votersin the swing states that mattered. The candidate's gender can hardly be blamedfor that.Lori Cox Han, PhD, is professor of political science at Chapman University.
