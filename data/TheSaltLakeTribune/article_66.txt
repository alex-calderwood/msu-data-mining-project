I stood paralyzed at the Sheraton Hotel watching the presidential electionreturns. When North Carolina went to the Republican candidate, I realized theelection was not going the way I had excitedly anticipated. I could not sleepthat night. The nightmare was all too vivid, unsettling and, as events unfolded,terribly real.In the coming days, I was shaky. I had trouble eating. I broke out in hives. Iknow personally the effects of trauma. It's visceral. It's tumbling intodarkness without the benefit of a ledge to hold onto.But there's also climbing back up, and the sooner that happens, the sooner Imove forward. And forward is fighting for core values I find lacking in theindividual elected and the administration he is assembling. It means continuingthe fight for environmental protections, and safeguarding dignity for allindividuals. It means sheltering communities the new administration threatens topurge.This election goes much deeper than Democrats and Republicans fighting forelection. This election is about principles I am not willing to compromise. Iwill not fall into line. I will not lay down my beliefs. I will step to the tuneof my drummer and to the tune of the values I hold close. I'm ready for thenoble fight. Hives are not forever.Christine FraizerSalt Lake City
