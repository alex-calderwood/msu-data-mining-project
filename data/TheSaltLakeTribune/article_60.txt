Washington - President-elect Donald Trump's meeting with one-time foe MittRomney is aimed more at hearing Romney's thoughts on world affairs and lessabout offering a job in the administration, Trump aides say.Romney, a former Massachusetts governor who now lives in Utah, harshlycriticized Trump as unfit for office in March and in subsequent comments. He isexpected to sit down with Trump at his golf course in Bedminster, N.J.,Saturday.Sean Spicer, the top Republican National Committee strategist helping withTrump's transition to the White House, told reporters that Trump wants to hearideas from everyone, including rivals."What that meeting suggests, and the meetings you've seen over past couple ofdays, is the president-elect wants the best and brightest people to put thiscountry forward: people who supported him, people who didn't support him,"Spicer said, likening the conversation with Romney to one Trump had with formerSecretary of State Henry Kissinger.The Romney meeting, Spicer said, is "just an opportunity to hear his ideas andhis thoughts."Trump is considering a role for Romney in the administration, according to newsreports, including for him to serve as secretary of state.Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch told reporters in Salt Lake City on Friday that he talkedto Trump the previous day, in part, about Romney."He is very high on Mitt," Hatch said. "Anybody would want to have Mitt on theirteam. I just hope they can get together because they have had a real split overthe years."Hatch added that Trump "feels badly about some of the dialogue they had togetherwhere he was kind of tough on Mitt." Also, "He wants to have a friendship there,so Mitt is coming back all the way from Hawaii to be with him."Hatch said, "I hope they can get together because these are two giants in theRepublican Party and two giants in politics, and they can help each other."The president-elect is also meeting this weekend with the former chancellor ofschools in the District of Columbia, an education activist, a retired MarineCorps general, the head of the Carl's Jr. franchise and the co-owner of theChicago Cubs, Todd Ricketts.Trump spokesman Jason Miller said that the meetings are not only about fillingspecific roles in his administration but also hearing from the "best, brightestand most-qualified people."Romney awkwardly accepted Trump's endorsement of his 2012 presidential bid butstaunchly opposed Trump during the Republican primaries this year, going as faras to call him a "phony" and a "fraud."Trump responded by noting that he has a lot of friends but "Mitt Romney isn'tone of them," and then questioning if Romney was really a Mormon. He is. Trumpalso referred to Romney as a "choke artist" and a "loser."After Trump's upset victory, Romney did extend best wishes to thepresident-elect.Trump's meetings since the election have been held in private and reporters havebeen kept away from even seeing the president-elect beyond his victory speech.Romney's meeting with Trump in New Jersey is likely to be in private as well,with reporters temporarily holding court in a "drainage ditch," according to apool report, as Trump's aides initially did not allow journalists into theprivate golf course. The media eventually was allowed on the property.tburr@sltrib.com
