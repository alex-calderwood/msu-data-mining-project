SAM JANESCHSJANESCH@LNPNEWS.COMLancaster County officials will discuss today the possibility of recountingvotes in nearly a dozen local precincts after Green Party presidential nomineeJill Stein challenged Pennsylvania's election results.Stein's last-minute effort - through a lawsuit and by mobilizing voters topetition against their local election results - to determine whether hacking orany other undue influence contributed to President-elect Donald Trump's roughly71,000-vote margin of victory over Hillary Clinton in Pennsylvania.In Lancaster County, 51 county voters filed petitions Monday asking for recountsof their precincts, Lancaster County Chief Registrar Randall Wenger said.But out of 240 county precincts, Wenger said only 11 would be eligible for arecount under the election code, which requires three different voters from aprecinct to all file petitions.The petitions, which allege there are discrepancies and errors "not apparent onthe face of the returns," led the county's Board of Elections to delay itscertification of election results to the Department of State, which was plannedfor Monday.While officials say that's an unusual step in itself, it may be unlikely toresult in any precincts actually being recounted.Josh Parsons, a Republican county commissioner and elections board chairman,said there are potentially two problems with the petitions that might not allowfor a recount under the election code.One is that the petitions don't allege specific discrepancies within theirparticular precinct, Parsons said. Another is that the code requires petitionsbe received before the county computes its final vote totals. That happened lastweek."If you can just simply allege that a recount should be done because somecomputer somewhere in the country was hacked, then anyone could do that for anyelection at any time," Parsons said. "And I don't think that's what the lawintended."Why they're challengingLaura Campbell, a Marietta resident who submitted a petition to recount herprecinct at the East Donegal Township Building, said she doesn't know if arecount would uncover any kind of voter fraud here.But it doesn't hurt to make sure, she says."I don't know if this will make any change, but I do think no matter who won,the results should be recounted to make sure the process was done correctly,"said Campbell, whose husband Abram also submitted a petition in their precinct.Kyrah Malan, a retired minister and hypnotherapist from Manheim Township, alsofiled a petition, saying she was convinced by arguments that electronic votingmachines could have been hacked using malware."If the vote counts are accurate, we will have the reassurance we need," shesaid. "If they aren't, we will know we have an important job to do."Historically, election recounts have resulted in very little changes to theoriginal results.Slim chancesPennsylvania Secretary of State Pedro Cortes has said a recount would result inbarely any difference and there is no evidence of cyberattacks or othertampering of the results.In Lancaster County, one of the most recent recounts was held in 2009, whenLancaster Township supervisor Tony Allen, a Republican, was unseated by DemocratBenjamin H. Bamford. The original tally had Bamford winning by a margin of 11votes out of 2,371 votes cast.After 27 registered voters petitioned the elections board for a recount, theelection result did not change, but Bamford's margin of victory grew by twovotes.For recounts of statewide race results, the chances of an overturned electionwinner are extremely rare, according to the nonpartisan election research groupFairVote. The group found, out of 4,687 statewide general elections between 2000and 2015, only 27 were recounted - and just three of those changed the outcome.The largest change of votes in a recount during that time was when Democraticpresidential nominee Al Gore gained 1,247 votes on Republican George W. Bush inthe 2000 Florida recount, which wasn't enough to flip the state.
