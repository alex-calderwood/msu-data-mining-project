Many Jewish journalists  were targeted by whitenationalists   on social media, threatened  for who they are and what theywrote. But journalists such as Julia  Ioffe and Ben Shapiro stood firm  in theface of harassment, and  their cause was aided by communal   leaders like theAnti-Defamation  League's Jonathan Greenblatt.At the same time, the notable role  played by the candidates' Jewish  familymembers spoke to Jewish  political empowerment. Never in  our memory did theDemocratic and  Republican nominee both have a  Jewish son-in-law  and in DonaldTrump's case, a Jewish daughter,  Ivanka, who is a brand unto herself.Jews dominated the cultural landscape,   in television, cinema, music,  books,fashion, theatre  up to Bob  Dylan's Nobel Prize. We also made  an unexpectedlystrong showing   in the sports arena, thanks to  Theo Epstein's leadershipbringing   the forlorn Chicago Cubs to  a World Series win and Aly Raisman'sstunning Olympics display.America's legal and business  sectors benefited from Jewish entrepreneurialingenuity, while our  religious and communal leaders  challenged orthodoxies ofall kinds.As always, the Forward's annual   list of Jews who have impacted  American lifeis a communal eff ort,  but special tribute goes to Dan  Friedman, Thea Glassmanand  Kurt Hoffman for their creativity   and leadership. This project  went topress hours after Trump's  stunning victory, opening an  uncertain chapter inthe American   Jewish story. But to paraphrase  the play that made Daveed Diggsfamous, the Jews in the Forward  50 never threw away their shot,  and we knowthey never will.
