LIMA, Peru - Leaders of 21 Asia-Pacific nations ended their annual summit Sundaywith a call to resist protectionism amid signs of increased free-tradeskepticism, highlighted by the victory of Donald Trump in the U.S. presidentialelection.The Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum also closed with a joint pledge towork toward a sweeping new free trade agreement that would include all 21members as a path to "sustainable, balanced and inclusive growth," despite thepolitical climate."We reaffirm our commitment to keep our markets open and to fight against allforms of protectionism," the leaders of the APEC nations said in a jointstatement.APEC noted the "rising skepticism over trade" amid an uneven recovery since thefinancial crisis and said that "the benefits of trade and open markets need tobe communicated to the wider public more effectively, emphasizing how tradepromotes innovation, employment and higher living standards."Speaking to journalists at the conclusion of the summit, Peruvian PresidentPedro Pablo Kuczynski said the main obstacle to free trade agreements in Asiaand around the world is the frustration felt by those left behind byglobalization."Protectionism in reality is a reflection of tough economic conditions," saidKuczynski, the meeting's host.Referring to Britain's vote to leave the European Union and Trump's election winin the U.S., he said those results highlighted the backlash againstglobalization in former industrial regions in the U.S. and Britain thatcontrasts with support for trade in more-prosperous urban areas and developingcountries."This is an important point in recent economic history because of the outcome ofvarious elections in very important countries that have reflected an anti-trade,anti-openness feeling," he said.This was the last international summit for U.S. President Barack Obama and hehad been expected to promote the Trans-Pacific Partnership pact, a 12-nationtrade deal. But he is no longer expected to seek ratification by Congress beforehe leaves office because of the election victory by Trump, who called theagreement a "disaster" for jobs.Leaders of other nations said at the APEC meeting that they might seek to modifythe TPP deal to make it more appealing to the incoming president or seek toimplement it without the U.S. But the statement issued at the close of thesummit said the organization would also work toward adoption of a broader21-nation pact favored by the Chinese government known as the Free Trade Area ofthe Asia Pacific.The  statement also said  members will adhere to  carbon reduction goals set inParis last year to address climate change, a problem  they called a threat tofood production and security.
