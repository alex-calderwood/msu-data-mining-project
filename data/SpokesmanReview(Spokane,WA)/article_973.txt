PARIS - Francois Fillon won France's first-ever conservative presidentialprimary Sunday after promising drastic free-market reforms and a crackdown onimmigration and Islamic extremism, beating a more moderate rival who had warnedof encroaching populism."President! President!" chanted the former prime minister's supporters as hedeclared victory over Alain Juppe in a nationwide run-off election.Polls suggest the sober, authoritative Fillon, 62, would have a strong chance ofwinning the French presidency in the April-May election, amid widespreadfrustration with France's current Socialist leadership.Fillon, who was prime minister from 2007-2012 under ex-President NicolasSarkozy, enjoyed a surprise surge in popularity in recent weeks. A rise innationalist sentiment across Europe may have favored his strict conservativepositions over Juppe's more centrist stance.France needs "a complete change of software," Fillon said, promising in hisvictory speech to defend "French values."Among his promises: slash public spending, cap immigration, support traditionalfamily values and reach out to Russian President Vladimir Putin.Juppe, 71, congratulated Fillon on his "wide victory." During the primarycampaign, he expressed similar ideas as his rival on the French economy, buttried to rally conservatives around a more tolerant attitude toward France'sethnic, religious and social diversity.With results from 96 percent of voting stations, organizers of the Republicansparty primary said Fillon had 66.5 percent of votes and Juppe 33.5 percent. Morethan 4 million of France's 44 million voters took part, which was considered agood turnout given that it was the conservatives' first experiment with aprimary.Fillon walked a careful line Sunday, stressing the need for "authority of thestate" but also insisting, "No one should feel excluded from a society that Iwant to see more just and with more solidarity."If elected next year, he pledges to hold a referendum on a quota system forimmigrants to reduce legal immigration "to a minimum," and to push for strongercontrols at Europe's borders.In a country still rattled by a string of deadly Islamic State group attacks,Fillon wants to prohibit French jihadists from returning home.A practicing Catholic with a British wife of 36 years and five children, Fillonpledges to weaken adoption rights for same-sex couples. Yet he has said hewouldn't scrap a 2013 law allowing same-sex marriage.His most dramatic proposals concern France's long-stagnant economy, beset bychronic 10 percent unemployment.He wants to cut taxes on businesses, slash public spending by 110 billion euros($116 billion) and reduce the number of public servants. He would also raise theretirement age from 62 to 65, extend the workweek beyond 35 hours, and easeFrance's strict labor rules in order to boost  hiring.Besides serving as prime minister, he's been a Cabinet minister six times andspent years as a lawmaker representing his hometown of Le Mans in westernFrance, home to the famed auto race.Sunday's runoff came after a bruising and highly adversarial end phase to themonthslong primary contest, an American-style effort to end party infighting andbolster support for the party's nominee. The conservatives previously chosetheir candidate internally.Fillon has said he wants to drop sanctions against Russia over its aggressiveactions in Ukraine and partner with Russia in the fight against Islamic Stateextremists. Fillon insists "Russia poses no threat" to the West.What's nextFillon's toughest challenge ahead is likely to be far-right leader Marine LePen. Le Pen, candidate of her National Front party, is running ananti-establishment campaign that particularly targets immigrants, France'sMuslim minority, and the European Union.Socialist President Francois Hollande is expected to announce in the comingweeks whether he will seek re-election, but the French left has been deeplyweakened by his extreme unpopularity. A wild card is outsider candidate EmmanuelMacron, Hollande's former economy minister, who is leading a centrist campaign.
