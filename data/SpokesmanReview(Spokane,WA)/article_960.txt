SACRAMENTO, Calif. - Supporters of a plan for California to secede from theunion took their first formal step Monday morning, submitting a proposed ballotmeasure to the state attorney general's office in the hopes of a statewide voteas soon as 2018.Marcus Ruiz Evans, the vice president and co-founder of Yes California, said hisgroup had been planning to wait for a later election, but the presidentialelection of Donald Trump sped up the timeline."We're doing it now because of all of the overwhelming attention," Evans said.The Yes California group has been around for more than two years, Evans said. Itis based around the ideas that California taxpayers pay more money to thefederal government than the state receives in spending, that Californians areculturally different from the rest of the country, and that national media andorganizations routinely criticize Californians for being out of step with therest of the U.S.Evans said he hopes to begin collecting signatures to get the measure on theballot in the spring. Qualifying ballot measures typically require significantresources to pay signature gatherers, and Yes California doesn't have majorfinancial backing. But Evans said 13,000 people have volunteered to collectsignatures.Various groups have made noise about California forming its own country in thewake of Trump's election, most prominently Silicon Valley financier ShervinPishevar. But similar proposals have dotted the state's political landscape foryears.Judges tossGOP-drawn mapsMADISON, Wis. - Federal judges struck down Wisconsin's Republican-drawnlegislative districts as unconstitutional on Monday, marking a victory forminority Democrats that could force the Legislature to redraw the maps.The three-judge panel didn't order any immediate changes to district boundaries,instead saying they would give state attorneys and the voters who challenged theold maps 45 days to offer suggestions.State lawyers plan to appeal the 2-1 ruling to the U.S. Supreme Court, but fornow the decision offers hope for Democrats who have been in the minority for sixyears and lost more ground in this month's elections.The following fields overflowed: KEYWORD = SECESSION:LA - national (300 words)
