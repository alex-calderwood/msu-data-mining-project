Stein alleges thatirregularities and the possibility that vote scanning devices could have beenhacked call the results into question. Elections officials in all three stateshave expressed confidence in the results.Michigan's recount could start as early as Friday, though a challenge to therecount by Trump may delay it.Meanwhile, Nevada election officials will recount ballots in five counties afterindependent presidential candidate Roque De La Fuente requested and paid about$14,000 for the effort.De La Fuente finished last in the state but this week requested a recount inNevada, a state Clinton won. De La Fuente said he wants to counterbalance therecount Stein requested in Wisconsin, which Trump won.Nevada Deputy Secretary of State for Elections Wayne Thorley said if recountresults show a discrepancy of at least 1 percent for De La Fuente or Clinton, afull state recount will be launched.Pelosi re-electedas House leaderWASHINGTON - House Democrats re-elected Nancy Pelosi as their leader Wednesday,ratifying the status quo in a changing Washington despite widespread frustrationover the party's direction.That disenchantment manifested itself in 63 lawmakers supporting Pelosi'sopponent, Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan, in the secret-ballot vote. That was by far thelargest defection Pelosi has suffered since she began leading House Democrats in2002.Still, the California lawmaker had declared ahead of time that more thantwo-thirds of the caucus was supporting her, and she won  just about two-thirdswith 134 votes. It was a testament to her vote-counting skills and  her abilityto hang onto power even in dark days for Democrats, as they confront a capitalthat will be fully controlled by the GOP next year.Soldiers won't have to repay bonusesWASHINGTON - Thousands of California National Guard troops will not have torepay enlistment bonuses and benefits they received a decade after they signedup to serve in Iraq and Afghanistan, according to a deal between House andSenate negotiators.The agreement is included in a must-pass defense policy bill filed Wednesday andawaiting an expected House vote Friday, followed by action in the Senate nextweek.The Pentagon had demanded the money after audits revealed overpayments by theGuard under pressure to fill ranks. But lawmakers are ordering the Pentagon towaive the recoupment of a bonus unless there is evidence that shows servicemembers "knew or reasonably should have known" that they weren't eligible toreceive the money.The Guard offered enlistment bonuses of as much as $15,000 and student loan aidto nearly 10,000 soldiers at the height of the two wars in the 2000s. Members ofthe California congressional delegation and veterans leaders expressed outrageover the Pentagon's decision to force troops who had served overseas to returnmoney when they said the fault lay with military recruiters.
