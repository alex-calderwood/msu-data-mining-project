President-elect Donald Trump spent Sunday ridiculing Hillary Clinton'spresidential campaign for joining a recount effort in Wisconsin, ending his dayon Twitter by parroting a widely debunked conspiracy theory that her campaignbenefited from massive voter fraud.As his senior advisers engaged in an escalating feud over who the next secretaryof state should be, Trump focused publicly on Clinton's tally of 64 millionvotes - more than 2 million more than he garnered - by suggesting withoutevidence that millions of people illegally voted in the election."In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popularvote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally," Trump tweetedlate Sunday, one of more than 10 tweets on the recount issue.That accusation - spread by conspiracy sites such as Infowars.com anddiscredited by fact-checking organizations - gained traction among somefar-right conservatives disappointed that Trump lost the popular vote.But Trump's embrace of the claim created even more instability around theelection results from both ends of the political spectrum, with Green Partycandidate Jill Stein leading calls among liberal activists for recounts in keybattleground states to make sure  voting fraud did not give the election toTrump.The charges and countercharges could present a highly toxic issue for theJustice Department, including Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., Trump's nominee to beattorney general, whose tenure, if confirmed, comes amid a long-running battleover renewal of the Voting Rights Act. The two parties are already locked infights over ballot access, with Republicans advocating ID requirements and otherlimitations that Democrats say are aimed at suppressing the votes of minoritiesand others more likely to vote Democratic.Trump spent the Thanksgiving weekend out of the public spotlight, holed upinside his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida and continuing his private deliberationsabout building the next administration. Kellyanne Conway, his former campaignmanager and now senior adviser to the transition team, said on NBC's "Meet thePress" that Trump and President Barack Obama spoke by phone for about 45 minuteson Saturday, the latest in a series of conversations the two men have had sincethe bitter campaign concluded.Conway also led a  rear-guard attack on 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney as apossible secretary of state, arguing that the former Massachusetts governor wasdisloyal to Trump and should not be considered for the post. The remarkshighlighted a fierce behind-the-scenes battle within the Trump camp over whetherRomney should be offered the job as a healing gesture with the establishment orinstead whether a loyalist such as former New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani shouldget the nod.Rather than referee that dispute, however, Trump's only public proclamationscame over Twitter  beginning at 7:19 a.m. Sunday, when he lambasted the Clintoncampaign for agreeing to take part in a recount of votes in Wisconsinspearheaded by Stein."Hillary Clinton conceded the election when she called me just prior to thevictory speech and after the results were in. Nothing will change," Trumptweeted.Trump then spent five tweets quoting parts of Clinton's responses at the thirdpresidential debate, during which she blasted Trump for telling moderator ChrisWallace that he would "keep you in suspense" rather than outright promise toaccept the election results.At the debate, Clinton had called Trump's answer "horrifying" and "a directthreat to our democracy."On Saturday, Clinton campaign counsel Marc Elias said Clinton's advisers hadbeen monitoring voting patterns in critical states to see whether there were anysigns of foul play, particularly in the wake of hacking of emails at theDemocratic National Committee and of senior campaign officials earlier thisyear. Elias wrote that no evidence of wrongdoing had emerged in theirpreliminary review.But once Stein's campaign formally started the recount process in Wisconsin,Elias said Clinton's campaign would join the effort even if her top advisers didnot expect the outcome to change in any of the Midwestern states that tipped theElectoral College balance to Trump.Clinton's campaign plans to do the same if Stein, who has raised more than $5million to help fund the recounts, follows through on plans to ask for the sameprocess in Michigan and Pennsylvania.The total margin in those three states was 107,00 votes out of nearly 13.8million cast, with a combined 46 electoral votes among them - enough to give therace to Clinton had she won those three battlegrounds.Clearly irritated by losing the popular vote, Trump suggested that the math togetting to the 270-vote margin in the Electoral College made him come up short."It would have been much easier for me to win the so-called popular vote thanthe Electoral College in that I would only campaign in 3 or 4 states instead ofthe 15 states that I visited," he tweeted.Meanwhile, the  feud over his pick for secretary of state hit a fevered pitchwhen Conway took to three Sunday television shows to attack Romney's credentialsto be the nation's top diplomat. Conway is part of a cadre of Trump confidantswho are waging an unusual public battle against Romney to influence thepresident-elect's decision.Romney's supporters have largely counseled Trump privately, while his opponents- Conway, former House speaker Newt Gingrich and a handful of other Trumployalists - have gone public in recent days to stoke a revolt.Those opposed to Romney have been advocating Trump to reward Giuliani with thesecretary of state position, stressing his loyalty versus Romney's refusal topublicly say who he voted for in the presidential race."I don't think a cost of admission for party unity has to be the secretary ofstate position," Conway said on ABC's "This Week," suggesting Romney went toofar in questioning Trump's character and intellect during the presidential race."There was the 'Never Trump' movement and then there was Governor Mitt Romney.He went out of his way to hurt Donald Trump."trump
