Trump should apologizeIn reading the description of the actions of the cast following VicePresident-elect Mike Pence's attendance at "Hamilton" and the transcript oftheir statement, I do not believe an apology is required.What is required is an apology to all U.S. citizens from Trump for his offensivebehavior during the presidential campaign.Anne OswaldSpokane ValleyForget differencesThose people who have been through decades of elections can confirm that it isnot always easy to swallow the defeat of their candidates. Some of us even gaveup eating peanut butter during the Carter years, but we never seriouslyprotested.The wimps and whiners are those students and professors who were too upset afterthe election to take or give exams, and those who damaged property whileprotesting. This group would do well to accept the famous quote by John F.Kennedy, "Ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for yourcountry." Our military have lived and died by that creed for us.Now we have the opportunity to forgive and forget differences and come togetheras one united nation.Elita JonesSpokaneElectoral College is fineMany voters are upset that Republican Donald Trump won the election and arecrying foul that the presidency was unfairly taken from Democratic rival HillaryClinton since she is ahead in the popular vote. Because their candidate lost theelection, they want to abolish the U.S. Electoral College in favor of a popularvote.Clinton's lead is due, in part, to the lopsided majority of about 4.4 millionvotes Clinton received in the two most liberal states, California and New York.Electing a president who does not have broad regional support could lead to afractured and less cohesive country.This was the reason the founding fathers chose the Electoral College. There wasa fear that the larger population in some states would give them inordinatepower when selecting the president. Alexander Hamilton summed up how he and manyof the framers may have felt about the system, noting "that if the manner of itbe not perfect, it is at least excellent."George WattersonSpokane Valleytext/cci-newsdesk
