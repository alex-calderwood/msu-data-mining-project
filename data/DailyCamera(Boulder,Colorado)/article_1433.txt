"It's deja vu all over again." -- Yogi BerraThey say that those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it. Soonce again this year, the so-called "Green Party" showed that it has learnednothing from history by endorsing a presidential candidate with absolutely nohope of winning the election, thus helping to propel yet anothernon-environmentalist, climate-change denier into the White House. As most of us will recall, Ralph Nader's Green Party candidacy in 2000 cost AlGore --a true environmentalist and author of "An Inconvenient Truth" aboutglobal warming -- the presidential election, despite Gore's overwhelming popularvote victory over "W." (Nader garnered over 97,000 votes in Florida, whichultimately went to Bush by only about 500 votes, thus giving Bush the ElectoralCollege plurality and the win.) This year, Jill Stein, who had no possible chance of winning the election, maywell have cost Hillary Clinton enough votes in Michigan (where Stein drew about50,000) and Wisconsin (31,000) to help propel Trump over the magical 270electoral vote mark. How ironic that it is Jill Stein who is now demanding a recount of this year'selection results in three key swing states. Barry Aaron Boulder
