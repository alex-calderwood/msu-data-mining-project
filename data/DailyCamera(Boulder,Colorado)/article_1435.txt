Alexander Hamilton contended, in Federalist No. 68, that the Electoral Collegeprevents influence by foreign interests in the U.S. presidential election. JamesMadison argued in Federalist No. 10 that the Electoral College protects theRepublic from mischiefs of faction, citizens united by a common impulse that isadverse to the rights of other citizens. The Electoral College was created toprotect the republic from a candidate like Donald Trump and it is time for theelectors to fulfill this duty. The electors have the constitutional right, andthe moral responsibility, to support the popular vote-winner in this election.Sharon Schryver Erie
