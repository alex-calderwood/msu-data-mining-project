At that time, she asked if he wasinterested in doing work with a presidential campaign. They would later solidifythe arrangement at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland.Two weeks later, Connaughton was in New York at Trump Tower pitching advertisingideas to Trump's top advisers, which included his children and son-in-law.After getting through five of his 30 slides of the presentation, he was hiredand hit the ground running on the campaign the next day. After being hired rightafter Labor Day, Connaughton would not come home to Mandeville for another fourweeks.He spent most of the time on the campaign trail making TV ads and interviewingthose attending Trump rallies."Winning a presidential race in our business is like winning the Super Bowl,"Connaughton said. "To be one of the hands on the steering wheel is a big deal. "He and his team produced roughly 30 national ads, including one called"Listening," and another titled "United. "Not only did Connaughton create ads but he also provided ad strategy andmessaging insight to the campaign. In August, he voiced the importance to Conwayfor Trump to visit South Louisiana after the devastating floods."We went back and forth about it for about 24 hours and finally I got a textmessage at about 4 p.m.," he said.
