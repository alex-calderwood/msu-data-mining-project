Leaders of the New York City Council have begun collecting signatures calling onPresident-elect Donald Trump promise not to leave his hometown footing the billfor protecting his family and buildingsCouncil Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito and Upper East Side Councilman DanielGarodnick-both Democrats and backers of Hillary Clinton's presidential bid-havealready attracted nearly 1,500 endorsements to a Change.org petition urgingincoming commander-in-chief to arrange federal reimbursements for the additionalcity security around his relatives and eponymous properties. The pair of localpols reiterated the widely reported $1 million-a-day estimated cost ofstationing police and other city resources and personnel around Trump Tower andother locations, a figure Mayor Bill de Blasio has refused to confirm."The provision of security services for presidents-elect must be the obligationof the federal government. And accordingly, we believe that the cost of thatobligation must be borne by the federal government, not the City of New York,"the petition reads. "And accordingly, we believe that the cost of thatobligation must be borne by the federal government, not the City of New York."The petition notes the nearly $83.5 billion the city intends to spend in fiscalyear 2017-not only on first responders, but education, sanitation, hospitals,housing, social work and city infrastructure"We already stretch our municipal budget to provide basic services," the pairwrote. "These services would suffer if we must divert funds to policeprotection."The city already allocated funds to enlarge the police force by some 1,300officers last June, around the same time Trump launched his improbable bid forthe White House. Now, it appears Trump plans to leave his wife and young son inNew York, and may return to the city himself on weekends."Should you or your family members choose to reside in Trump Tower for anylength of time following your inauguration, the cost of security for that timealso should be borne by the federal government," Mark-Viverito and Garodnickwrote. "While NYPD is both equipped and able to participate in ensuring your andyour family's protection, we must not allow this cost to blow a massive hole inNew York City's budget."The two Council members ended with an appeal to Trump's hometown pride."Let's end the suspense: We ask you to commit the necessary federal funds toreimburse New York for all costs of protecting you and your family-both beforeand after your inauguration as President of the United States of America," thepetition reads. "As a lifelong New Yorker, you understand the importance of avibrant local economy, and one that has the resources to operate. Make it cleartoday that New York City is not going to get stuck with the bill."The Council shared the petition through its official Facebook page.Trump's team did not respond to a request for comment. However, Staten IslandCouncilman Joseph Borelli-the president-elect's most vocal and visible supporterin the five boroughs-agreed generally with his colleagues' insistence thatWashington should cover the added expenses.But he disputed the $1 million daily price tag, citing numbers from theIndependent Budget Office that found protecting President Barack Obama during arecent two-day visit cost the city just $250,000"There's just no truth that the million-dollar a day number is accurate," hesaid, noting that the city has long extended extra personnel to guarding theheadquarters of the Clinton Foundation. "I don't recall any of these Democratscomplaining when former President Clinton set up his office in New York City andthere were additional security costs."De Blasio said recently he had made a "very, very strong case" to the currentadministration for refunding the city for its Trump-related expenditures so far.Both requests for reimbursements come as de Blasio and Mark-Viverito have vowedto defy Trump's deportation and Muslim registry plans, which city ComptrollerScott Stringer has warned could endanger some $7 billion in federal outlays foranti-terrorism efforts, public housing, hospitals and other social services.Read the petition in full below:At an estimated $1 million per day, protecting you, your family and your home atTrump Tower will total over one billion dollars during your four-year term. Thisrepresents an extraordinary financial burden for New York City taxpayers. We theundersigned, including the Speaker of the New York City Council, Melissa MarkViverito; your local City Council Member, Dan Garodnick; and the many, manyordinary New Yorkers whose taxes contribute to New York's budget, stronglybelieve that the provision of security services for Presidents-elect must be theobligation of the federal government. And accordingly, we believe that the costof that obligation must be borne by the federal government, not the City of NewYork. We already stretch our municipal budget to provide basic services-likepolice, sanitation, and the education of 1.1 million public school students.These services would suffer if we must divert funds to police protection.Further, should you or your family members choose to reside in Trump Tower forany length of time following your inauguration, the cost of security for thattime also should be borne by the federal government. While NYPD is both equippedand able to participate in ensuring your and your family's protection, we mustnot allow this cost to blow a massive hole in New York City's budget. Let's endthe suspense: We ask you to commit the necessary federal funds to reimburse NewYork for all costs of protecting you and your family-both before and after yourinauguration as President of the United States of America. As a lifelong NewYorker, you understand the importance of a vibrant local economy, and one thathas the resources to operate.
