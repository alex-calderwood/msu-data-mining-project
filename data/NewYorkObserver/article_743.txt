Since last month's presidential election, there's been plenty of social mediavitriol aimed at people on both sides of the political spectrum-in one extremeexample, a Silicon Valley CEO resigned after threatening to kill President-electDonald Trump.The latest election-related Facebook flap comes courtesy of George Buch, agraduate assistant and math instructor at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.On Wednesday night, during a conversation about "illegal aliens," Buch wrotethat he would turn undocumented students in to Immigration and CustomsEnforcement (ICE) officials."Your family came here illegally, why do others get to skip the lines," hewrote. "I've never won Powerball...doesn't mean I get to rob a bank becauseothers have millions."Buch also bragged that there are "no safe spaces in (his) classes.""I don't mind diversity, I mind criminals," he concluded.The Consolidated Students of the University of Nevada (CSUN) condemned Buch'scomments."CSUN will not tolerate behaviors that undermine our university community todamage the overall student experience," the group said in a statement. "We arecommitted to speaking out against discrimination and hate speech in order toadvance the cause of equality for all students."In a statement to the UNLV student newspaper Thursday night, Buch apologized forhis comments, calling them "a joke, although clearly a poor one.""I have never, nor will I ever, create a classroom of hate or intolerance," hesaid. "These students and their success mean everything to me, and I'm sorrythat I put them in jeopardy."The UNLV administration has not yet taken any disciplinary action against Buch,but a spokesperson said university president Len Jessup made his position "quiteclear" last week, when he joined over 380 other college and universitypresidents across the nation in signing a letter in support of the DeferredAction for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program and undocumented immigrantstudents.DACA, which was established in 2012 through an executive order by PresidentBarack Obama, allows undocumented immigrants to the United States who enteredthe country before their 16th birthday to receive a work permit and maintainexemption from potential deportation. Trump has hinted that he would revoke thepolicy when he takes office.Disclosure: Donald Trump is the father-in-law of Jared Kushner, the publisher ofObserver Media.
