Perhaps, at the end of week of major Impressionist/Modern and Contemporary artsales at Christie's, Sotheby's and Phillips, the big surprise was that there wasno big surprise. Still lagging oil prices, the effect of Brexit on the Britishand European economies and, most of all, the unexpected results of the U.S.presidential elections, appeared to have little impact on art buying behavior."We usually schedule our Impressionist and Modern sale for the week before ourcontemporary sale," said Jeremiah Evarts, head of Sotheby's Impressionist andModern evening sales, "but this year we thought it a better strategy to putdistance between the election and the auctions, insulating the market players bymoving the sale to the contemporary week." That strategy seems to have worked,as international stock markets dipped briefly in the immediate aftermath ofDonald Trump's victory but then recovered and even moved higher. "Whateverworries they had the week before, they moved on," he said.Those pre-auction jitters were "more on the minds of our sellers than ourbuyers," said Christie's head of post-war and contemporary art Sara Friedlander,which made it "challenging to put together these sales." One collector, shestated, had considered consigning a major piece but decided to hold off untilnext May before putting it up for sale.Still, Friedlander noted that the strong prices and a "high sell-through rate"indicated that "art is one of the more stable things in the world and,considering the recent election, people are happy to be thinking about artinstead of other things." This is not a "frothy moment when people areoverpaying," but spend collectors did, if quite often nearer the lower estimatethan the higher.There were no nine-figure prices for works in any of these sales, reflecting theauction houses' difficulties in obtaining the most exceptional consignments at atime when the art market does not appear to be as robust as in past years, asNatasha Degen, professor and chair of their art market master's program at NewYork's Fashion Institute of Technology, told the Observer. "If I had anine-figure work of art, I'm not sure that I would put it up for sale right now,either," she admitted.Philip Hoffman, founder and chief executive officer of the Fine Art Group inLondon, called the week's sales "exceedingly ordinary except for maybe 10 lots,but with all the uncertainty leading up to these auctions ordinary does notsound all that bad." Both he and Manhattan art advisor Suzanne Modica found thatthe contemporary art sales were livelier affairs than those of Impressionist andModern art. "Just sitting in the gallery during the auctions, there seemed to bemore excitement during the contemporary sales, more bidding," she said.There were a number of record prices set throughout the various sales,including:Claude Monet's 1891 Meule (Grainstack). $81.4 million (estimate "in the regionof $45 million"): Christie'sWillem de Kooning's 1977 Untitled XXV. $66.3million: Christie's ("The opening price was pretty aggressive, but I guess theyneeded to do that to win the consignment," Hoffman said. "And it turned outalright.")Wassily Kandinsky's 1935 Rigide et Courbe. (Rigid and Bent). $23.3million (estimate $18-25 million): Christie'sJohn Currin's 1999 Nice 'n Easy.$12 million (estimate $12-18 million): Christie'sDavid Hockney's Woldgate Woods,24, 25, and 26 October 2006. $11.7 million (estimate $9-12 million):Sotheby'sLászló Moholy-Nagy's 1923 porcelain enamel on steel Em 1 Telephonbild.$6 million (estimate $3-4 million): Sotheby's ("A connoisseur's choice, a supersophisticated work, which is reflected in the fact that the buyer was the Museumof Modern Art," said art advisor Todd Levin, director of the Levin ArtGroup.)Njideka Akunyili Crosby's 2012 acrylic and colored pencil Drown. $1.09million(estimate $200,000-300,000): Sotheby'sCarmen Herrer's 1965 Cerulean.$970,000 (estimate $600,000-800,000): PhillipsMira Schendel's 1985-86 Sem titulo(XII). $970,000 (estimate $800,000-1.2 million): PhillipsMike Kelley's 1984 CavePainting. $516,500 (estimate $500,000-700,000): Sotheby'sPerhaps, one post-war artist whose collectors might have been reticent aboutselling was Agnes Martin, for whom only work was put up for sale, her 1983Untitled #6, which Christie's estimated at $5-7 million and achieved $6.7million with buyer's premium. A retrospective of the artist's work, organized bythe Tate Museum in London, is currently on view at New York's Guggenheim Museum(through January 11). "When there is a current exhibition, there usually is alot of buzz, and we expected that the market might be flooded by her work,especially since we set an auction record for her work last May," Friedlandersaid, referring to Martin's oil and graphite on canvas Orange Grove, whichearned $10,693,000 (estimate $6.5-8.5 million). The strong price for Martin'sUntitled #6, she suggested, reflects the "market's sense" that "her work isundervalued."The artist who may have been the biggest winner of the week for whom there wasno record auction price set is 84 year-old German artist Gerhard Richter, whoseworks were sold by Christie's, Phillips and Sotheby's, and images of hispaintings were the covers of both Phillips and Sotheby's contemporary artcatalogues. The Sotheby's November 17 contemporary art sale included seven ofthe artist's paintings from the Steven and Ann Ames collection, of which sixsold, among them the 1988 A.B. St. James($22,737,500) and the 1986 A. B. Still($33,987,500). As one New York art advisor noted, "Richter has entered thepantheon that has long included Picasso, Pollock and Warhol, the standard bearerof a commodified currency."By the numbers, Sotheby's evening November 14 sale of Impressionist and Modernart brought $157.7 million, down from last year's $306.7 million, and the numberof lots was a bit lower (42 this year as compared to 47 in 2015) while thepercentage of sales was a bit higher (81 percent, as compared to 76 percent).Christie's November 15 evening sale of post-war and contemporary art earned $277million, down a bit from last year's $331.8 million, but the number of artworksfor sale (61 this year, 66 in 2015) and the percentage of lots sold (89 percentthis year, 80 percent in 2015) were in the same general range.Christie's November 16 Impressionist and Modern Art sale generated $246.3million in sales, which was higher than last year's $145.5 million, with thehigher totals achieved with fewer artworks for sale (48 this year, 59 last year)and similar percentages sold (81 percent this year, 83 percent in 2015).Phillips November 16 evening sale of 20th century and contemporary art earned$111.2 million, a sizeable jump over last year's inaugural sale in this categoryof $66.9 million, and selling 92 percent of the offerings, similar to 2015's 90percent sell-through rate.Sotheby's November 17 sale of contemporary art earned $276.6 million, close tolast year's 294.6 million, with more artworks for sale (64, compared to 2015's54) and a higher sell-through rate (93 percent this year, 81 percent in 2015).
