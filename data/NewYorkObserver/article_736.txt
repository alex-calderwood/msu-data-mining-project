Queens Congressman Gregory Meeks argued today that, even though House Democratslack the power to subpoena President-elect Donald Trump over his potentialconflicts of interest, they can and should use their posts to pressure him todivulge information about his companies' dealings.Last week, the New York Times asked Trump in a sit-down interview at theiroffice about his mixing of personal financial interests with his presidency,citing the fact that he temporarily halted his transition work to meet withthree Indian business partners, exerted pressure on British and Argentinianpoliticians to accommodate his business concerns in their nations and gathereddiplomats at his new hotel in Washington D.C. The incoming commander-in-chiefbrushed off the concern, claiming  falsely that the "president can't have aconflict of interest."Meeks promised that the Democratic minority would convene informal hearings andtour the nation in order to draw public attention to potential malfeasance onTrump's part-saying that they "intend on utilizing those voices as we moveforward.""Though we may not have the power to subpoena individuals, I'm sure that therewill be some that would be willing to come at our request to testify at thosehearings," Meeks, a strong supporter of Hillary Clinton's candidacy, toldCNNMoney's Cristina Alesci today. "And of course as a member of Congress, wealways have the power of the bully pulpit, and we intend on utilizing thatpower."Meeks, a senior member of the House Financial Services Committee who has servedas a prosecutor and has been the subject of ethics probes, predicted thatRepublican committee chairs will work to protect Trump. But the out-of-powerDemocrats can still petition various agencies asking them to provide the resultsof investigations and report back to them what they find and are investigating.Democrats on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee sent a letterto Utah Congressman Jason Chaffetz, the committee's GOP chairman, today notingthat it has now been two weeks since ranking Congressman Elijah Cummings ofMaryland wrote him requesting that the committee immediately start reviewingTrump's financial arrangements to identify and protect against conflicts ofinterest."If he refuses, then we in Congress must fulfill our own responsibilities byclosely examining the Constitutional and statutory provisions that govern Mr.Trump's actions, determining whether his approach meets these standards, andproposing appropriate reforms," they wrote.And although some of the agencies will be headed by the president-elect'sappointees, Meeks said that they are still answerable to Congress-also pointingout that midterm elections are "just two short years away" for the House ofRepresentatives and various Senate seats and "just four short years away" forthe next presidential election."Well a number of them will be but still, they are accountable to all members ofCongress and so they still have to give as a reply as to what they are or arenot doing and what they're finding and if they're not doing an investigation asto why," Meeks continued. "And then it is up to us to then make sure that theAmerican public knows what's going on."Trump, for his part, has sought to shift responsibility by alleging that thenews media is responsible for making a big deal about his various businessinterests.Prior to the election it was well known that I have interests in properties allover the world.Only the crooked media makes this a big deal! - Donald J.
