Bronx Assemblyman Michael Blake-a top organizer in President Barack Obama's 2008campaign-looked to assure African immigrants that Donald Trump's proposed Muslimregistry plan will be met with widespread backlash and ultimately collapse.On the campaign trail, Trump has said he will ban Middle Eastern immigration tothe United States and that he would require Muslims to register themselves. Hewas heard discussing a network that would register and track Muslims throughoutthe country in a November 2015 video."I think it would be very difficult for him to go down that road," Blake said ona community conference call on what a Trump presidency means for the Africancommunity. "I think he would probably lose the community for generations for theparty and I think they will rationally try to walk him back from that."Trump's spokesman, Jason Miller, has denied that such a plan is or ever wasbeing considered.Blake asserted the best strategy that Muslims can employ is to collect anecdotesof the impact such an action will have on communities, saying that there's"really no way for us to effectively prepare otherwise.""To the question of the registry, look, I think it is hard for us to actuallyhave a strategy to convey to the African community of exactly what willpresident-elect do," Blake said. "I think, again, I think the approach being oneof being as proactive as possible."And the plans for a Muslim registry are not the only unknown in the Trump era,according to Blake-he says the future of President Barack Obama's AffordableCare Act is unclear."We know the president-elect has conveyed that some parts will stay, some partsmay not," Blake said. "We don't know what that will be. It's important foreveryone to know that you can continue to enroll in the Affordable Care Actnow."Ditto for Obama's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, an executive ordershielding people who arrived in United States illegally as children fromdeportation-an initiative that covers nearly 800,000 youth, including 50,000 inNew York, and which Trump has promised to repeal."[I don't know] if any of us know what DACA looks like moving forward," he said. "It would be very difficult for us to ascertain what a Trump [administration]would do."Blake stressed the importance of having a Democratic State Senate to ensureprotection for immigrants, speaking about the need for the passage of the DREAMAct, which would grant state tuition assistance to undocumented students. Hesaid that the Black, Puerto Rican, Hispanic and Asian Legislative Caucus wasconvened yesterday and that there is unanimous support to move forward and to bevery active and clear."We're hopeful that the bills that we move forward will get this done," Blakesaid.The lawmaker commended Mayor Bill de Blasio and Gov. Andrew Cuomo for thepositions they have taken in the aftermath of Trump's victory, insisting thatthe city and the state remain committed to protecting all residents but alsoindicating that they may be able to find common ground with Trump on someissues. And like the mayor, he said that he will fight against Trump's pledge toinstitute more aggressive stop-and-frisk policing throughout the country as afederal policy.The assemblyman himself filed a complaint against the NYPD in August after hesaid he was slammed into a gate by a police officer."Be very mindful of the rhetoric of stop and frisk as a national policy," Blakesaid. "We say absolutely that we are in opposition of that being a nationalpolicy."The assemblyman said during the call organized by the African LeadershipProject-who included residents, advocates and community leaders-that they shouldinteract with elected officials at the federal, state and local levels.Disclosure: Donald Trump is the father-in-law of Jared Kushner, the publisher ofObserver Media.
