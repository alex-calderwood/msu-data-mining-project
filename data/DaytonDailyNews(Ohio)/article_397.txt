In August, then-Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump (right) welcomespro-Brexit British politician Nigel Farage to speak at a campaign rally inJackson, Miss. Trump would like Farage to be the U.K. ambassador to the U.S.LONDON - Donald Trump has a plan for making the vaunted relationship betweenBritain and the U.S. even more special: Make the impish acting leader of the UKIndependence Party, Nigel Farage, British ambassador in Washington.Prime Minister Theresa May had another idea: Leave the appointment to theBritish government, thank you very much.Her representatives Tuesday quickly shot down Trump's extraordinarilyundiplomatic initiative, which the president-elect expressed in a tweet thenight before."Many people would like to see @Nigel_Farage represent Great Britain as theirAmbassador to the United States. He would do a great job!" Trump said.The Farage farrago suggested that Trump and the British prime minister aren'toff to a warm start, and that, in the Trump era, Farage will be a force to bereckoned with.Trump's unusual effort to pressure the British government into naming Farage towhat is widely viewed as its most prestigious diplomatic post focused newattention on the unorthodox UKIP figure who played a key role in convincingBritish voters to leave the European Union in a June referendum.Foreign Minister Boris Johnson and others said there was no way Farage would bechosen - and some in Parliament had a few laughs at the prospect -promptingawoundedFarage to accuse May and her Cabinet, members of theConservative Party, of living in the past and slowing down the Brexit process.He said their personal dislike for him was hurting Britain."The world has changed and it's time that Downing Street did too," Farage saidon the pro-Trump Breitbart website.Farage's words had a hard edge. He said "a new order" is taking over inWashington, while in Britain the top players remain the same.He complained that politicians who had favored keeping Britain inside the EUbloc - a position favored by May before the referendum - remain in charge ofU.K. policies.Taking an apparent swipe at the tousle-haired Johnson, who in the past calledTrump "out of his mind," Farage said politicians who once denounced Trump "nowpretend" to be his friend.There is little question that Trump sees Farage as a potential friend.Trump endorsed the Brexit movement even as it was opposed by President BarackObama and other global leaders.
