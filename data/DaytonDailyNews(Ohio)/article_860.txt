A ballot recount in Pennsylvania may occur for Green Party Presidential nomineeJill Stein and Hillary Clinton. Voters stand outside the Schuylkill Townshippolling station in Phoenixville, Pa.The top lawyer for Hilary Clinton's presidential bid said Saturday that thecampaign would join Green Party Presidential nominee Jill Stein in her effort toseek a full recount in Wisconsin, and potentially two other states.WASHINGTON- The top lawyer for Hillary Clinton's presidential bid said Saturdaythat the campaign would join a third-party candidate's effort to seek a fullrecount in Wisconsin, and potentially two other states, though he said thecampaign had seen no "actionable evidence" of vote hacking.In a post on Medium, Marc Elias, the campaign's general counsel, described anintensive behind-the-scenes effort by the campaign to look for signs of Russianhacker activity or other irregularities in the vote count.The essay suggested that the campaign was joining the recount effort with littleexpectation that it would change the result. But many of the campaign'ssupporters, picking up on its frequent complaints of Russian interference in theelection, have enthusiastically backed the recount effort led by Jill Stein, whowas the Green Party candidate.Stein filed for a recount in Wisconsin on Friday afternoon, about an hour beforethe deadline. She has raised more than $5 million for the effort, which now willturn to Michigan and Pennsylvania, where there are deadlines this week.In his post, Elias sounded less enthusiastic than the recount's many supporters."Because we had not uncovered any actionable evidence of hacking or outsideattempts to alter the voting technology," he wrote, "we had not planned toexercise this option ourselves."He added, "Now that a recount has been initiated in Wisconsin, we intend toparticipate in order to ensure the process proceeds in a manner that is fair toall sides."Should Stein pursue additional recounts, "we will take the same approach inthose states as well," he wrote. But he noted that the "number of votesseparating Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton in the closest of these states -Michigan - well exceeds the largest margin ever overcome in a recount."The Clinton campaign will not contribute financially to the effort, which hasbeen funded by small contributions. But it will pay to have its own lawyerspresent at the recount, campaign officials said.Trump issued a statement Saturday calling the recount push "ridiculous" and "ascam by the Green Party."He suggested that most of the money raised would not actually be spent on therecount."The results of this election should be respected instead of being challengedand abused, which is exactly what Jill Stein is doing," said Trump, who himselfsuggested in the weeks before the election that the vote could be rigged.In Wisconsin, Trump leads by 22,177 votes. In Michigan, he has a lead of 10,704votes, and in Pennsylvania his advantage is 70,638 votes.The Obama administration issued a statement Friday in response to questionsabout intelligence findings related to Russian interference in the election. Inthe statement, it said it had concluded that the election had been free ofinterference.The administration issued a second statement on Saturday saying that "thefederal government did not observe any increased level of maliciouscyberactivity aimed at disrupting our electoral process on Election Day."It added: "As we have noted before, we remained confident in the overallintegrity of electoral infrastructure, a confidence that was borne out onElection Day. As a result, we believe our elections were free and fair from acybersecurity perspective."Clinton conceded the race to Trump early Nov. 9, when it became clear that hewould have a large margin of victory in the Electoral College. But as her leadin the popular vote has grown - it now exceeds 2 million votes - her base hasincreasingly pressured her to challenge the results.That has been fueled in part by how aggressively the Clinton campaign spread theword of Russian involvement in the theft of emails from the Democratic NationalCommittee and from the personal account of John Podesta, the campaign'schairman. The campaign also charged that the Russians were behind fake newsabout Clinton's health, among other stories - a claim supported to some extentby recent studies.Some critics saw those accusations as an effort to shift the discussion frommistakes the Clinton campaign had made in taking on Trump.Now Clinton finds herself in a difficult position of not wanting to lead thecharge for a recount that Democrats believe will go nowhere, but also notwanting to abandon supporters who have donated to Stein's last-ditch effort.Elias' post offered a revealing look at how much time and energy the campaignhas spent in the past two weeks looking for evidence of Russian hacking or otherirregularities, and how it has tried to keep those efforts secret."Since the day after the election, we have had lawyers and data scientists andanalysts combing over the results to spot anomalies that would suggest a hackedresult," Elias wrote. "These have included analysts both from within thecampaign and outside, with backgrounds in politics, technology and academia."He said those efforts had been followed by "numerous meetings and calls withvarious outside experts to hear their concerns and to discuss and review theirdata and findings." The campaign shared its data as well."Most of those discussions have remained private, while at least one hasunfortunately been the subject of leaks," he wrote, a reference to conversationsbetween Podesta and a group of experts that included J. Alex Halderman, acomputer scientist with deep experience in the vulnerabilities of votingsystems.Halderman put his own post on Medium early Thursday, describing his suspicionsand the case for recounts. But even he doubted the election result would change.
