U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, is calling on President-elect Donald Trump toretract his statements that millions of Americans voted illegally in the 2016election."Your choice to spread false conspiracy theories and to claim millions offraudulent votes is not only unbecoming of a gracious winner, it is downrightdangerous to our democracy," Brown wrote in a letter to Trump. "There is noevidence - zero - of any large-scale voter fraud in the United States. Not inthis election and not in any presidential election in recent memory."Peddling this nonsense and stoking these fears undermine our system ofgovernment - and your own election, damaging the public's faith in ourdemocracy."With less than two months beforeTrumpassumesoffice, Brown is emerging as aconsistent critic of the Republican and president-elect.Brown on Tuesday blasted Trump's selection of Rep. Tom Price of Georgia asSecretary of Health and Human Services, saying the pick would endanger Medicare.Price has been generally supportive of efforts to privatize Medicare, supportinginstead block grants for such programs."To hand the reins to someone with Congressman Price's long record of trying toprivatize Medicare is a direct betrayal of Donald Trump's campaign promise toprotect and strengthen the program for America's seniors, and you can bet wewill do everything in our power to block any attempt to hand the Medicareprogram that seniors have worked their whole lives for over to Wall Street,"Brown said.In his letter to Trump, Brown urged Trump to "reach out to the majority ofAmericans who voted for someone else and unite Americans based on our nation'sshared values.""Instead, we're already hearing talk of plans to privatize Social Security, toraise the Medicare retirement age, to give huge handouts to Wall Street at theexpense of the middle class, and to roll back laws that safeguard our air andwater and protect American consumers.That is far from the compromise and cooperation we need at this difficult time."Contact this contributingwriter at jwehrman@dispatch.com.
