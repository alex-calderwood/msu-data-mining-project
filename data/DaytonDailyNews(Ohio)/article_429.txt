LANSING,MICH.-GreenParty presidential nominee Jill Stein on Wednesday requesteda full hand recount of Michigan's presidential vote, making it the third statenarrowly won by Republican Donald Trump where she wants another look at theresults.Stein previously asked for recounts of the votes in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.President-elect Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton by about 10,700 votesout of nearly 4.8 million ballots cast in Michigan, or two-tenths of apercentage point. But Stein alleges that irregularities and the possibility thatvote scanning devices could have been hacked call the results into question.Electionsofficialsinallthreestates have expressed confidence in the results.Michigan's recount could startasearlyasFriday,though a challenge to the recountby Trump may delay it."We simply won't know if there was hacking or interference in this electionunless we look at the votes - every vote systematically, impartially and byhand," Jessica Clarke, a lawyer for the Stein campaign, said during a newsconference outside of the Michigan Bureau of Elections.University of Michigan computer scientist Alex Halderman, who says votingmachines and optical scanners that count ballots are prone to errors and outsidemanipulation, told reporters that the recount will show "for sure" whethercyber-attacks have occurred."More importantly, (the recount) will provide a defense in the future and adeterrent to any adversary who might want to try to hack future elections."Trump's victory is highly unlikely to be reversed in any of the states.The GOP says a Michigan recount would cost taxpayers far more than the $973,000Stein paid when filing her recount petition.Secretary of State Ruth Johnson, a Republican, called Stein's request "unusual,"especially since there is no evidence of fraud or "even a credible allegation ofany tampering."Nevertheless, county clerkshavebeengearingupto complete this recount under avery challenging (Dec. 13) deadline," she said. "They'll be working nights andweekends. I know they will do a great job because we have some of the bestclerks in the country here in Michigan."
