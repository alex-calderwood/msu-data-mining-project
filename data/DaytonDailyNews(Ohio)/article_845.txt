Trump Foundation were made in a 2015 tax filingreleased after a presidential election in which it was revealed that Trump hasused the charity to settle lawsuits, make a $25,000politicalcontributionandpurchase items such as a painting of himself that wasdisplayed at one of his properties.The filing's release comes as the New York attorney general's officeinvestigates whether Trump personally benefited from the foundation's spending.The 2015 tax filing was posted on the nonprofit monitoring website GuideStar onNov. 18 by someone using an email address belonging to the foundation's lawfirm, Morgan, Lewis & Bockius, said GuideStar spokeswoman Jackie EnterlineFekeci.In the tax filing, the foundation acknowledged that it used money or assets inviolation of the regulations not only during 2015, but in prior years. But thetax filing doesn't provide details of the violations.Questions sent via email t o T r u m p's t ra n s i t i o n team weren'timmediately answered Tuesday.Marcus S. Owens, a partner at the Washington law firm Loeb & Loeb and a formerdirector of the IRS exempt organizations division, said the lack of detail inthe tax filing makes it difficult to determine the extent of the charity'sviolations."There's no way to tell for sure whether the self-dealing is small and trivialor large and a pattern of ongoing deliberate misuse of the charity's assets,"Owens said.Generally,hesaid,self-dealing violations require the violator to pay an excisetax equal to 10 percent of the amount involved in the transactions. The violatoralso would have to repay the foundation for the full amount involved. Owensnoted that self-dealing is a violation of New York state law, where the charityis registered.New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, a Democrat, launched aninvestigation into the charity after reporting by the Washington Post drewattention to some of the foundation's purchases, three of which are listed inthe latest filing: two portraits of Trump and a football helmet autographed byformer NFL quarterback Tim Tebow.The Post reported that Trump bid $12,000 for the football helmet, and his wife,Melania, bid $20,000 for one of the portraits. The other portrait, for whichTrump bid $10,000, has been hanging on a wall in a building at his golf coursein Doral, Fla,, according to the Post.Despite the high price tags, the foundation's latest tax filing now values theportraits and helmet at a combined $1,675. The tax filing does not specify ifany of the items are related to the self-dealing violations.The foundation has previously said it amended its tax filings after it gave animproper $25,000 check to a political committee supporting Florida AttorneyGeneral Pam Bondi in 2013.Charities are barred from engaging in political activities, and thepresident-elect's staff says the check he signed was mistakenly issued followinga series of clerical errors. Earlier this year, the Trump Foundation paid a$2,500 fine to the IRS over the check.The latest tax filing shows two Trump entities gave to his foundation, a breakfrom recent years when the foundation's donations came mostly from other donors.The Trump Corp. gave about $566,000 to the foundation, and Trump ProductionsLLC, the company which produced "The Apprentice" and "Celebrity Apprentice,"gave $50,000 in 2015.
