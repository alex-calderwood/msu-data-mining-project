President-elect Donald Trump, followed by his wife Melania and son Barron,boards his plane at Palm Beach International Airport, Sunday in West Palm Beach,Fla., as the family returned to New York after the holiday weekend.WEST PALM BEACH, FLA. - President-elect Donald Trump claimed without evidenceSunday that "millions" voted illegally in the national election, scoffing atHillary Clinton's nearly 2 million edge in the popular vote and returning to hiscampaign mantra of a rigged race even as he prepares to enter the White House inless than two months.Trump and his lieutenants assailed an effort - now joined by Clinton - torecount votes in up to three battleground states, calling the push fraudulent,the work of "crybabies" and, in Trump's estimation, "sad."The president-elect went on to cast a shadow over the legitimacy of an electionthat he actually won, tweeting that "I won the popular vote if you deduct themillions of people who voted illegally." He further contended that if thepopular vote determined the presidency, "It would have been much easier for meto win" it because hewould have altered his campaign to pile up overall votetotals, not Electoral College votes.There's been no indication of widespread vote manipulation, illegal voting orhacking that materially affected the outcome one way or the other. It's thatvery lack of evidence that suggests Trump is likely to prevail in recounts.As Trump worked to fill foreign policy and national security posts in hisCabinet, a top adviser expressed astonishment that 2012 GOP presidential nomineeMitt Romney remained under consideration for secretary of state after hiscampaign-long questioning of Trump's character, intellect and integrity.Trump on Sunday tweeted part of Clinton's concession speech, when she toldsupporters they must accept that "Donald Trump is going to be our president,"and snippets from her debate remarks, when she denounced the Republican nomineefor refusing to say in advance that he would accept the Election Day verdict.This came on top of his saying it was a "scam" that Green Party nominee JillStein was revisiting the vote count in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania.Trump won Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, and as of Wednesday, held a lead of almost11,000 votes in Michigan, with the results awaiting state certification Monday.His Michigan margin was a hair's breadth 0.22 percent of the state's votes.Clinton leads the national popular vote by close to 2 million votes, but Trumpwon 290 electoral votes to Clinton's 232, not counting Michigan. She couldconceivably tip the electoral balance in the remote event that all flipped toher in recounts.Trump planned to return to New York on Sunday after spending Thanksgivingweekend at his West Palm Beach estate. His transition team said thepresident-elect had scheduled a series of meetings today with prospectiveadministration hires.Among the jobs Trump has still yet to fill: secretary of state. Internaldivision over the position again spilled out into the open on Sunday as Trumpsenior adviser Kellyanne Conway voiced her concerns with the possibility ofRomney landing such a significant position.Trump supporters "feel a bit betrayed that you can get a Romney back in thereafter everything he did," Conway said. "We don't even know if he voted forDonald Trump. He and his consultants were nothing but awful to Donald Trump fora year." She added that she was "reflecting what the grassroots are saying."Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani and Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker are amongother prospects to serve as the country's top diplomat."I'm all for party unity, but I'm not sure we have to pay for that with thesecretary of state position," Conway said.Trump's incoming chief of staff,nationalpartyChairman Reince Priebus,acknowledged that Romney would represent "a team of rivals concept."Trump was mostly silent on the brewing recount effort until it became known thatClinton would join it, at least in Wisconsin. On Saturday, a day after Wisconsinofficials said they would conduct the first presidential recount in the state'shistory, Clinton campaign attorney Marc Elias said: "We intend to participate inorder to ensure the process proceeds in a manner that is fair to all sides."Elias said Clinton would take the same approach in Pennsylvania and Michigan ifStein were to follow through withrecountrequestsinthose states.That loosened Trump's tongue."Hillary Clinton conceded the election when she called me just prior to thevictory speech and after the results werein,"TrumptweetedSunday. "Nothing willchange."He quoted from her concession speech - "We owe him an open mind and the chanceto lead" - and he concluded: "So much time and money will be spent - sameresult! Sad."On NBC's "Meet the Press," Conway said Stein, "the Hillary people" and otherssupporting recounts have to decide whether they are going to back a peacefultransition "or if they're going to be a bunch of crybabies and sore losers aboutan election that they can't turn around."Priebus,on"FoxNewsSunday," called the effort a "total and complete distractionand a fraud and something that they should drop."Clinton's lawyer said her team has been combing through the results since theelection in search of anomalies that would suggest hacking by Russians or othersand found "no actionable evidence" of an altered outcome. Moreover, Elias said,Trump has a vote lead even in the closest states that well exceeds the largestmargin ever overcome in a recount.
