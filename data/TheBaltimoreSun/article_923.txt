Some parents and students fought back against criticism of Baltimore Countyschools Superintendent Dallas Dance at the school board meeting Tuesday night,saying that he was right to show concern for students who might be fearful theday after the election.Dance came under criticism for a retweet he made on election night that askededucators to reach out to students who may have felt maligned during the U.S.presidential campaign.The tweet from Josh Starr, a former Montgomery County superintendent, said:"Educators: tomorrow pls show your muslim, black, latino, jewish, disabled, orjust non-white St's, that you love them and will protect them!"June Keating, a 10th-grade student at Towson High School, said she was not a fanof Dance's but that she felt compelled to speak up on his behalf. "The post heretweeted called for love and support, not for hatred, discrimination ordivisiveness," she said. She said as a white student, she did not feel it wasracist against white students, as some of Dance's critics have contended.Brooks Morales, a Baltimore County parent and Baltimore City teacher, said thereis a need to show compassion to children who are fearful."In the days after the election, I have dried tears of kindergarten students whoare afraid that their families won't be safe, and my response to them is thesame that any of yours would be: You are safe at school," she said.Signs in the back of the school board meeting room said "Love for All Students"and "We Stand With Dallas Dance." On the other side were signs that read "Donewith Dance" and "Remove Dance."None of those who spoke at the meeting criticized Dance. The board did notcomment.The tweet was posted on a Baltimore County parent's Facebook page and drew firefrom some Baltimore County politicians. The debate continued with parents,legislators and school board members contending on Facebook.Some parents have suggested that Dance should resign over the incident or befired. The majority of the board, however, appears unconcerned by his tweet.liz.bowie@baltsun.comtwitter.com/lizbowie
