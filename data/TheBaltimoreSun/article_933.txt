Baltimore County Executive Kevin Kamenetz, weighing in on a divisive politicalbattle that has erupted since Donald Trump was elected president, added his nameMonday to the growing list of Democrats vowing to shield immigrants fromdeportation.Kamenetz, who is considering a bid for governor in 2018, said he supportsefforts by universities to create "sanctuary campuses," and said he had directedcounty police to avoid taking part "in any effort" to identify the immigrationstatus of students.But the announcement - which followed similar statements from leaders inBaltimore, Montgomery County and cities across the country - likely has more todo with political symbolism after a bitter presidential election campaign thanany change in how the county will deal with immigration.In a not-so-subtle nod to that political context, Kamenetz used part of theletter to call on Republican Gov. Larry Hogan - a potential rival in 2018 - tosupport protecting undocumented immigrants at all of Maryland's universities.A spokesman for Hogan did not respond to a request for comment."I strongly support your efforts to protect undocumented students fromdeportation in the wake of the recent presidential election," Kamenetz wrote ina letter to the leaders of the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, TowsonUniversity and three other schools in the county."I have also advised Chief [James W.] Johnson that the Baltimore County PoliceDepartment should not participate in any effort to identify otherwiselaw-abiding students from our college campuses that would subject them todeportation by federal authorities," Kamenetz wrote.Freeman A. Hrabowski III, UMBC's president, told students and faculty this monththat he's working to understand options under state and federal law to make theschool a sanctuary campus for students in the country without legaldocumentation.Mike Lurie, a spokesman for the University System of Maryland, which includesCollege Park, UMBC and 10 other institutions, said individual schools may choosenot to help federal agents enforce immigration laws.Republicans in Baltimore County and elsewhere were quick to dismiss Kamenetz'smove as political."The 2018 election is two years away," said County Councilman David Marks, aRepublican who represents Towson."I support Governor Hogan's call for a thoughtful approach to this issue, andregardless, think the county executive's staff should consult with the CountyCouncil before issuing press releases," he said. "After all, we approve thefunding for the police and community college system."As a practical matter, neither federal nor local law enforcement officials arelikely to storm college campuses in search of student immigrants. But if theyhave a warrant, law enforcement may pursue a suspect regardless of any sanctuarypolicy put into place.The authority of local police to enforce immigration law is sharply limited.The Supreme Court, ruling in 2012 on a controversial state immigration law inArizona, said police may ask about a person's immigration status as part of aroutine interaction for another issue - a traffic stop, for instance - as longas it does not prolong that contact.But local police, in most cases, may not stop someone for the sole purpose ofasking for papers, and they cannot carry out immigration raids independent offederal agents, said Lena Graber, special projects attorney with the ImmigrantLegal Resource Center in California.Local police "don't have a basis to do it on their own," Graber said. "Arizonatried to give police a basis to stop people, and it was struck down, because itwas pre-empted."Still, Kamenetz's letter underscored a clear rhetorical difference betweenjurisdictions in Maryland run by Democrats and Republicans.Owen McEvoy, a spokesman for Anne Arundel County Executive Steven R. Schuh, saidthe Republican is "committed to assisting our federal partners in enforcingfederal immigration law."McEvoy said Arundel is "not contemplating any action similar to BaltimoreCounty's." He said officials there viewed Kamenetz's letter "as just anotherpolitical stunt of someone obviously eyeing a run for governor."Before the election, Schuh's administration was considering working with theObama administration to house detained immigrants at the Ordnance RoadCorrectional Center in Glen Burnie.GOP officials in Carroll and St. Mary's counties - both of which are also hometo four-year universities - did not respond to repeated requests for commentabout the "sanctuary campus" movement in Maryland.After Trump's election, Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake reaffirmed hercommitment to a 2012 executive order that prohibited city police from askingabout a person's citizenship status.Big-city police departments have tried for years to steer clear of enforcingfederal immigration law for fear of scaring away immigrants who might needservices or be useful in criminal investigations.Baltimore, like New York, Chicago and others, is widely considered a "sanctuarycity." Trump has suggested cutting federal funding to such cities.But the term is ill-defined, and it is not at all clear whether that fundingwould actually be in jeopardy. In Maryland, the attorney general's office hasadvised against taking some of the actions Republicans have sought, suggestingit could open local governments up to constitutional challenges.Trump campaigned on a promise to end a program established by President BarackObama that has allowed undocumented immigrants who were brought to the countryas children to stay.Since the election, the Republican has softened his rhetoric. Where he once saidhe would deport 11 million undocumented immigrants, he has since suggested hewould focus on 2 million to 3 million who have committed crimes since arrivingin the U.S. - an approach similar to Obama's.Todd Eberly, a political scientist at St. Mary's College, described Kamenetz'sletter as a political tactic.The Democrat "has got to line up support among the most committed activistmembers of his own party," Eberly said. "For him to publicly make this pledge -which in and of itself is meaningless - he's sort of staked out a position."john.fritze@baltsun.comtwitter.com/jfritze
