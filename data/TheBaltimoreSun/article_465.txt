HIGHLIGHT:Â Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, 75, said hisresignation letter is effective at noon Inauguration Day.JIM LO SCALZO/EPAWASHINGTON - Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said Thursday thatRussia curtailed its election-related cyberactivity after the Obamaadministration accused Moscow of trying to interfere with the presidential race.The top intelligence official, who has held the position since 2010, also saidhe had submitted a resignation letter effective at the end of President BarackObama's term.Clapper, in one of his last appearances on Capitol Hill, defended theadministration's response to allegations that intelligence officials at the U.S.Central Command, which oversees the Middle East, pressured analysts to discardinformation that reflected poorly on the war effort in Iraq and Syria.He also predicted that the information warfare that Russia has conducted sincethe Soviet era would likely continue beyond the U.S. election cycle.Hacked emails from Democratic Party officials were released by the anti-secrecygroup WikiLeaks during the presidential campaign, revealing details embarrassingto Democrat Hillary Clinton's campaign.Clapper and the Department of Homeland Security said in October that based onthe "scope and sensitivity" of the hacking efforts, only Russia's "senior-mostofficials" could have authorized the hacking. Russia has denied involvement."After the issuance of the statement and the communication that I know tookplace between our government and Russian government, it seemed to have curtailedthe cyberactivity that the Russians were previously engaged in," Clapper said.He said he was referring to the "cyber-reconnaissance" that had been observedprior to the statement. "That sort of activity seemed to have curtailed," hesaid.He said intelligence agencies don't have good insight on when or how WikiLeaksobtained the hacked emails.The committee chairman, Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., took Clapper, along with twodefense officials who testified, to task about allegations that CENTCOM massagedintelligence reports to make it appear the U.S. was doing better than it was inIraq and Syria.Nunes said lawmakers have not seen any "meaningful correction actions" taken bydefense or intelligence officials. The allegations are still being investigated.Clapper noted that a recent survey of intelligence employees has shown increasesin the percentage of employees who think their reports have been satisfactorilyhandled."This is a one-year period, but it does show a positive trend," Clapper said.On Ukraine, Clapper predicted that Russia would sustain its presence in theeastern part of the country. Russia's annexation of Ukraine's Crimean Peninsulaand its support for separatist rebels in the east brought relations between thetwo ex-Soviet neighbors to the verge of full rupture.Also on Russia, Clapper said he did not foresee a change in Russian aggressionin NATO countries in light of President-elect Donald Trump's plan to seekimproved U.S.-Russia relations.He noted that Russia's only aircraft carrier recently deployed to theMediterranean Sea - an indication that "the Russians are there to stay."On his retirement plans, Clapper, 75, said it "felt pretty good" to submit hisformal letter of resignation Wednesday. All top administration officials signresignation letters before they depart Jan. 20. Clapper said his resignationletter is effective at noon on Inauguration Day."I got 64 days left and I think I'd have a hard time with my wife anything pastthat," he said.
