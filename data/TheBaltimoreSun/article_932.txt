NEW YORK  - The effort to recount votes in the presidential race, led by GreenParty candidate Jill Stein and joined by Hillary Clinton's campaign, marched onMonday in three states, based partly on the Stein campaign's unsubstantiatedassertion that cyberhacking could have interfered with electronic votingmachines. Wisconsin officials approved plans to begin a recount as early asThursday.Stein also asked for a recount in Pennsylvania and was expected to do the samein Michigan, where officials certified Trump's victory Monday.Trump has angrily denounced the recounts and now claims without evidence thathe, not Clinton, would have won the popular vote if it hadn't been for "millionsof people who voted illegally." On Twitter, he singled out Virginia, Californiaand New Hampshire.There has been no indication of widespread election tampering or voter fraud inthose states or any others, and Trump aides struggled Monday to back up theirboss' claim.Spokesman Jason Miller said illegal voting was "an issue of concern." But theonly evidence he raised was a 2014 news report and a study on votingirregularities conducted before the 2016 election.-Associated Press
