President-elect Donald Trump's naming of veteran Wall Street banker andhedge-fund manager Steve Mnuchin to be the next Treasury secretary quicklyturned into a polarizing appointment on Wednesday as financiers cheered theselection while watchdog groups warned that it could lead to rollbacks ofcrucial post-crisis regulations.Mnuchin, who was a Goldman Sachs partner before starting Dune Capital Managementand later running Pasadena lender OneWest Bank, confirmed the appointment in anearly morning appearance on CNBC. He appeared alongside billionaire investorWilbur Ross, who was named Commerce secretary.Mnuchin said his top priorities would be to hasten economic growth and jobcreation through tax cuts and a loosening of post-crisis financial regulations."We're really going to be focused on economic growth and creating jobs," saidMnuchin, 53, whose appointment must be confirmed by the Senate. "Our mostimportant priority is sustained economic growth."He boldly predicted the economy could sustain an annual growth rate of as highas 4%, about twice as fast as the economy has grown since 2009.Mnuchin, who served as Trump's campaign finance chairman, had long beenconsidered a top contender for the Treasury post, though his selection runscounter to the the anti-establishment rhetoric of the Trump campaign.Throughout this year's presidential campaign, Trump criticized Democraticcandidate Hillary Clinton for being too cozy with Wall Street.A Trump ad that aired during the final days of the campaign called hedge fundmanger George Soros -- a Clinton supporter who is a business associate ofMnuchin -- someone who controls "the levers of power in Washington."It also implied that Goldman Sachs, where Mnuchin's father also was a partner,has been the beneficiary of policies that have "robbed our working class." Theadd featured footage of Goldman Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein at a ClintonGlobal Initiative event.Mnuchin spent 17 years at Goldman before leaving in 2002 to work with Soros.Later, he started Dune Capital, a hedge fund that was his entree to Hollywood.An offshoot of Dune Capital financed Hollywood blockbusters including "AmericanSniper" and "Mad Max: Fury Road."Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), a leading financial industry critic, calledMnuchin "the Forrest Gump of the financial crisis" because he "managed toparticipate in all the worst practices on Wall Street" during his lengthycareer."His selection as Treasury secretary should send shivers down the spine of everyAmerican who got hit hard by the financial crisis, and is the latest sign thatDonald Trump has no intention of draining the swamp and every intention ofrunning Washington to benefit himself and his rich buddies," she said.Dennis Kelleher, chief executive of Better Markets, a nonprofit that advocatesfor tighter Wall Street regulation, called Trump's Treasury pick and promises oflooser financial rules "a flip-flop of historic proportion.""We had candidate Trump who got elected promising to drain the swamp of specialinterests," Kelleher said. "Now we have President-elect Trump promoting thebiggest swamp-dwellers into his administration."But those establishment credentials don't worry some Trump supporters, includingTim Donnelly, a hard-right conservative who served two terms in the CaliforniaAssembly and ran unsuccessfully for governor in 2014.During that campaign, he pilloried fellow Republican candidate Neel Kashkari --currently serving as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis -- forhis role in overseeing the federal bank bailout program in 2008 and 2009."If [Trump] picked someone like Jamie Dimon or Blankfein or one of those guysfrom the old guard, that would be the establishment," Donnelly said Wednesday."We're counting on him putting successful people in charge of executing. Theexecution is more important than the purity."The president-elect's transition team was reportedly considering othercandidates, including Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase & Co., and Rep.Jeb Hensarling (R-Texas), chairman of the House Financial Services Committee.Any of those choices probably would have been cheered by Wall Street -- Dimon isone of the banking industry's top executives and Hensarling has called forrolling back financial regulation.Though Mnuchin is less well known, his selection drew praise from Tim Pawlenty,head of the Financial Services Roundtable, a Washington organization thatrepresents the nation's largest banking and financial services companies."Steve is a seasoned and results-oriented leader who is really smart, interestedin public policy and understands the urgent need to boost economic growth andopportunity," said Pawlenty, a former Republican governor of Minnesota.But how Mnuchin might seek to boost growth has consumer advocates and WallStreet critics nervous.During the campaign, Trump said he would seek to dismantle much of theDodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act, a sweeping 2010 bill that sought to rein inbig banks and prevent another financial crisis.Mnuchin said on CNBC that he does not want a wholesale repeal, but does want tomake substantial changes."We want to strip back parts of Dodd-Frank that restrict banks from lending,"Mnuchin said. "The No. 1 priority will be to make sure banks lend."Kelleher said that Mnuchin should instead subject more financial firms to thekind of strict scrutiny now reserved for the largest banks."If you have a Treasury secretary who doesn't think that type of regulation isappropriate, the country is going to end up in a disastrous situation. TheAmerican people will once again be surprised with the equivalent of anotherAIG," Kelleher said, referring to the massive insurance company that had to bebailed out in 2008.For Democrats and consumer advocates, hearing Mnuchin talk about a rollback ofDodd-Frank is troubling given his recent history in the banking business.Mnuchin in 2009 led a group of wealthy investors -- including Soros and MichaelDell -- who bought failed Pasadena mortgage lender IndyMac and turned it intoOneWest Bank.Mnuchin's group netted billions thanks in large part to a much-criticized dealthat allowed the investors to buy the bank at a big discount while passing offas much as 75% of its loan losses on the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Mnuchinand his group paid about $1.6 billion for the bank and sold it last year to NewJersey lender CIT Group for $3.4 billion.Between the sale price and hefty dividends paid out from 2011 to 2015, Mnuchinand his group made a profit of more than $4 billion. It's not clear how much ofa profit Mnuchin personally made, because his stake in OneWest was undisclosed.Despite its secure financial footing, OneWest had a history of problems withregulators over its foreclosure practices and lending and has been accused ofbeing unwilling to work with borrowers seeking mortgage loan modificationsdespite promises to do so. Community groups have accused the bank of beingparticularly aggressive about foreclosing on properties in minorityneighborhoods.In 2011, dozens of activists protested the practices on the lawn of Mnuchin's22,000-square-foot Bel-Air mansion. That same year, the federal Office of ThriftSupervision hit the bank with a regulatory order saying it had failed to followprocedures when foreclosing on homeowners.Similar complaints nearly derailed the CIT deal last year and continue to dogthe now-combined institutions. Two California advocacy groups this month askedthe federal Housing and Urban Development Department to investigate OneWest andCIT, accusing them of failing to make mortgage loans or locate branches inminority communities, and not properly maintaining foreclosed homes in thosecommunities. HUD is already investigating OneWest's reverse-mortgage business."Steve Mnuchin ran a foreclosure machine," said Paulina Gonzalez, executivedirector of the California Reinvestment Coalition, which fought the CIT-OneWestdeal and is one of the groups asking HUD to investigate the banks fordiscrimination.Mnuchin, a divorced father of three who graduated from Yale, defended OneWest onWednesday."We bought the worst mortgage portfolio in the history of time," he said ofIndyMac, adding that the bad loans that led to the foreclosures had beenoriginated before his purchase of the bank."We saved a lot of jobs and we created a lot of opportunities for corporateloans," he said.--james.koren@latimes.comTwitter: @jrkoren
