A divisive election that left half the country deflated and the other halfrejuvenated could reverberate through the holiday shopping season in the kind ofgifts people are giving or how much they spend.Some retailers say they have seen a surge in feel-good items such as spatreatments, candles and comfort food, while executives at some major retailerslike Wal-Mart, Target and Macy's have said there's no discernible shift inconsumer behavior since the presidential election won by Republican DonaldTrump.The divide in the outlook may reflect the rift in the election, as Americanssplit along geographic lines as well as by income."I don't need a comfort dog. I don't need anybody to feel sorry for me," saidRhondi Bleeker, 50, of Totowa, N.J. "I'm actually happy because I was forTrump."Bleeker, who owns an eyelash extension business, believes the economy will bebetter now. She says she'll still be spending the same $3,000 as she does everyholiday season, but she believes her business could do even better because,whether people are sad or happy, most will want retail therapy.Some shoppers say they plan to divert money from traditional gifts like sweatersto donations to charity groups in their friends' or relatives' names.Ryan Holmes of Chicago, who voted for Democrat Hillary Clinton, said he plans todevote at least one-quarter of the $750 he typically spends on holiday gifts todoing that. Even for gifts like music or books, he says he can't help but feelthat he might make a political statement such as giving a book on climate changeto educate a friend."I am frightened about what's to come, and sad and less hopeful," said Holmes,34, an urban planning and real estate consultant. But he added, "I'm feelingmore engaged."Shoppers have generally been moving away from buying "stuff" and more towardspending on experiences. Factors from the weather to when Thanksgiving fallsalready affect how stores fare at the holidays, and retailers from departmentstores to discounters are under intense pressure from online sellers to offerlow prices and convenience.A dip in buying before a presidential election is normal because people aredistracted, but spending usually bounces back afterward.States that voted Democratic have seen the biggest drops since the election,analysts say."We are in uncharted territory," said Gerald Storch, chief executive of Hudson'sBay Co., which operates department stores under that name, Lord & Taylor andSaks Fifth Avenue.The divide could play into the hands of retailers who customize goods to caterto increasingly fragmented tastes. Peter Gold, chief marketing officer at MarketAmerica's online marketplace Shop.com, says since late October he has seen asales surge in spa products, candles and comfort food that he expects willcontinue through the holidays.
