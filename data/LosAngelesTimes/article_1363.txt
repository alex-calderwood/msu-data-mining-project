The Trump Organization spent months trying to drive off the culinary union fromits Las Vegas hotel, losing one legal battle after another before a federallabor board.Soon Donald Trump's company, which has refused to bargain with the union afterhousekeepers and other employees voted to join last December, could gain someleverage.As president, Trump will be able to appoint two new members to the NationalLabor Relations Board, giving the agency a 3-2 Republican majority that could bemore sympathetic to Trump."We hope that Mr. Trump doesn't use his power to interfere, considering he has afinancial interest in the outcome," said Bethany Khan, spokeswoman for CulinaryWorkers Union Local 226.Khan's concern is but one of many examples of potential conflicts of interestthat could arise for Trump the president versus Trump the businessman. His vastholdings include hotels, office buildings and golf courses, and he has licensingdeals around the globe.For example, Trump's corporate lenders include Deutsche Bank, which has been intalks with the Justice Department to settle a mortgage securities case forpossibly billions of dollars, a process that the Trump administration couldinherit.China, a frequent target of Trump's criticism during the campaign, has lentmillions of dollars through the state-owned Bank of China to a Manhattan officetower on Avenue of Americas co-owned by Trump."How will this impact Trump's official relationship with China in his capacityas president?" asked Fred Wertheimer, president of Democracy 21, a watchdoggroup.Similarly, as president, Trump will be able to name the new General ServicesAdministration head, who will oversee negotiations regarding the governmentlease to Trump of the castle-like Old Post Office Pavilion in Washington, whichhis company recently refurbished into a luxury hotel."In this particular instance, President-elect Trump is both landlord andtenant," said Paul S. Ryan, vice president of policy and litigation for CommonCause.And once president, Trump will appoint the head of the Internal Revenue Service,overseeing the audit of his taxes, a process that he frequently cited as thereason for not releasing his returns as other presidential candidates have done."We have never seen in modern times anything like the array of conflicts createdby the president-elect's extraordinary web of domestic and global businessrelationships, investments and partnerships," said Norman Eisen, chief WhiteHouse ethics lawyer in President Obama's first term. Eisen and many others haveurged Trump to sell his assets and put the proceeds in a blind trust managed byan independent party.Trump said during the campaign that he would turn over control of his businessempire to his children while he retained ownership. Trump's three oldestchildren -- Donald Jr., Ivanka and Eric -- are executive vice presidents of theTrump Organization, the conglomerate based in New York.But experts widely agree that such an arrangement would do little to preventpotential conflicts because Trump is well aware of how his actions as presidentmight affect his businesses; and his adult children, who are serving on thetransition team, may have an ongoing advisory role in the administration.It's also unclear how much Trump will step back from his business interests oncehe is president. Just last week, he reportedly met at Trump Tower with threereal estate executives from India who are building a luxury apartment complexthere that will bear Trump's name. A spokeswoman said the meeting was simply acourtesy call from the executives, including one who is managing partner of thefirm that represents the Trump brand in India. But news accounts in Indiadescribed it as a business meeting in which the executives talked with Trumpabout expanding their partnership in India.Calls to the Trump Organization and to Trump's White House transition team werenot returned.Trump said on Twitter on Monday night that journalists were making too much ofhis potential conflicts: "Prior to the election it was well known that I haveinterests in properties all over the world. Only the crooked media makes this abig deal!"Vice President-elect Mike Pence says Trump is "completely focused on thepeople's business.""I'm very confident, working with the best legal minds in the country, that thepresident-elect and his family will create the proper separation from hisbusiness as he goes forward," Pence said on "Fox News Sunday."Trump's supporters balk at the idea that the president-elect would use hisoffice to enrich his businesses, noting that he has an estimated wealth in thebillions.That's cold comfort to Noah Bookbinder, executive director of Citizens forResponsibility and Ethics in Washington."If that's true, then he should have no problem with selling those interests andputting them in a true blind trust," Bookbinder said. "Second, this is a personwho's gotten to where he is by fighting for every penny, not paying people whathe has owed them because he didn't think their work was up to standards, ortaking every possible tax break.... The pattern that we've seen is not someonewho doesn't really care about maximizing his own profit."After a big primary win in March, Trump used the occasion of a victory rally andnews conference at the Trump National Golf Club in Jupiter, Fla., to brag aboutthe golf property and other Trump businesses. Since his election, Trump hastempered such explicit promotion of his brand, but his daughter's jewelrybusiness drew fire recently after it made a blatant attempt to capitalize onIvanka's wearing of a $10,800 gold bracelet during a postelection familyinterview with "60 Minutes." Ivanka Trump Fine Jewelry later apologized.For watchdog groups like Bookbinder's, it is all the more unsettling because thepublic doesn't know the extent of Trump's business interests. His companies areprivately held, and Trump still refuses to release his income tax returns.Nothing in the law would prevent Trump from running his conglomerate or evenprofiting from it while in office. Apart from annual financial reportingrequirements, federal conflict-of-interest rules for government employees andmembers of Congress don't apply to the president."To my eye, the primary concern is ensuring that as he makes political decisionsas president, that they're understood to be broad policy decisions and notdecisions driven by the desire to benefit financially from them," said Robert D.Lenhard, a senior attorney at Covington & Burling who was a member of theFederal Election Commission in 2006 and 2007.Rep. Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, the top Democrat on the House Oversight andGovernment Reform Committee, has called for the panel to "immediately begin areview" of Trump's financial arrangements, but the Republican-controlledCongress isn't expected to jump on the issue.Given that Trump was elected with people knowing he has extensive businessinvolvement, Lenhard doesn't see it as necessary for Trump to sell his companiesand assets. He thinks the public might be satisfied with something like anagreement for a "firewall" between Trump and his children so that they do nottalk about the family business.Trump's far-flung ventures raise particular concerns. The "emoluments clause" inthe Constitution broadly prohibits officeholders, including the president, fromaccepting presents "from any King, Prince, or foreign State." This is meant toprotect against corruption and undue influence from foreign powers, but theclause has rarely been used and would be especially difficult to enforce whengifts are indirect or inadvertent. Foreign officials or state-owned enterprises,for example, could try to curry favor by partnering with or investing in one ofTrump's companies, or even booking the most expensive suite in Trump's hoteldown the street from the White House.Such arrangements raise the same type of pay-for-play concerns that Trump andRepublicans levied against his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, and theClinton Foundation stemming from her time as Obama's secretary of State.Past presidents also have faced questions about conflicts involving them, theirrelatives and business dealings. Lyndon B. Johnson and his wife put theirmultimillion-dollar radio holdings and other assets in a blind trust, althoughthere's evidence it wasn't exactly blind, as the main trustee belonged to a firmwhose partner was an old friend of the president.When George H.W. Bush was president, a little-known company named Harken Energy,whose board included son George W. Bush, landed a lucrative contract from thegovernment of Bahrain. At the time the deal was viewed as an effort by thePersian Gulf nation's royal family to gain favor with the Bush administration.Obama came into office in 2009 having rolled most of his investments intoTreasury bills, which made up the bulk of his 2008 assets of between about $1.2million and $6 million, according to a financial disclosure form filed with theU.S. Office of Government Ethics.What makes Trump's potential for conflicts so unusual is the range and scope ofhis business interests, unprecedented for an American president.Trump has said that he is worth $10 billion, and his financial disclosure reportwith the Federal Election Commission in May listed interests in more than 500domestic firms and foreign entities. And these may not include all the venturesin which he receives licensing fees for having his name on accessories,apartments and other things that are located or sold around the world.Sometimes even the Trump Organization seems to have trouble keeping track of hispartners and ventures.In Baku, Azerbaijan, Trump reported almost $3 million in income in the last twoyears, mostly for selling the rights to the Trump name.Only later did Trump managers learn that the partner in the hotel project wasthe son of a government official -- and that he was suspected of launderingmoney for Iran's military. The project appears to have collapsed.--don.lee@latimes.comjim.puzzanghera@latimes.comTimes staff writer Joseph Tanfani contributed to this report.
