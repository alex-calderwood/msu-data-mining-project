With a gloom hanging over them after the election of Donald Trump, leaders ofthe California Democratic Party this weekend began plotting how to combat thepolicies of the incoming Republican president, discussing how to reach out tothe millions of disaffected voters who supported the president-elect.The two-day strategy session, held by the party's executive committee nearMission Bay, was part therapy session and part pep rally.Democrats commiserated about the implications of the GOP controlling the WhiteHouse and Congress, but also celebrated an election that handed the Democrats anear iron grip on California.Rep. Keith Ellison of Minnesota, who is campaigning to become the next chairmanof the Democratic National Committee, told a packed hotel ballroom of hundredsof party loyalists that the grass-roots activism that turned California solidlyblue needs to be replicated in every county across the nation."We lost this election for three reasons: turnout, turnout and turnout," Ellisonsaid. "We're not seeing some sort of electrification of the conservative voter.We are not getting our people out to vote."Some of the state's most influential Democrats criticized the party for failingto recognize the economic despair felt by Donald Trump's supporters across theU.S., including in pockets of inland California. Others insisted the party hadstrayed too far from its liberal base, losing young voters and otherprogressives who put President Obama into the White House.Environmental activist Tom Steyer, a San Francisco hedge fund billionaire whohad been thinking about a 2018 run for governor, said he may now forgo thatopportunity because of the threats posed by the Trump administration againstefforts to combat climate change and protect immigrants as well as otherDemocratic policies that reflect "California values."Instead, he said, he may plow his efforts into protecting California laws toreduce carbon emissions and working to expand the state's progressive policiesacross the nation."Donald Trump's election was a shocking mistake of historical proportions. Hisdangerous ideas and policies threaten the freedom, the safety and the prosperityof every American," Steyer said. "This is our moment. We will rise to theoccasion because there is no one else."Former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, who announced a bid for governorjust after the Nov. 8 election, said many voters in the Rust Belt and America'sheartland -- as well as in California's Central Valley and northern areas --flocked to Trump because they felt bypassed by the new economy and overlooked byleaders in Washington and Sacramento."Yes, we're the sixth-largest economy in the world, and yes, we're growing jobs,but we're not growing them everywhere. And a lot of people feel left out," hesaid. "There are 3 million people [in California] who voted for Trump. We've gotto ask them why."State Controller Betty T. Yee also warned fellow Democrats that, despite thestate party's successes on election day, they should not dismiss the swell ofsupport for Trump and other Republicans throughout the country, in large partbecause many Americans are struggling financially."One of the immediate things we have to do is to be sure that the red wave doesnot hit California. And it has the very potential to do that," Yee said. "Thereare pockets of this state that have not been touched by government, by anyonewho wants to bring services to them."Throughout most of the day, party leaders tried their best to highlight thesignificant gains made by Democrats in California in the election. Democratssecured a supermajority in the Assembly and are on the verge of doing the samein the state Senate, which would give them the political power to raise taxesand send proposals to the ballot without Republican support.Dana Dean, president of the Solano County Board of Education, said Democratsmade history this election. Not only did the Democrats select the first womanever to be the presidential nominee of a major political party, but HillaryClinton also won the popular vote, she said."It's OK to take a moment and say, 'Whoa, that hurt,' " Dean said. "But we alsohave to realize all that we accomplished."Among the California Democratic Party leadership, there were strident calls foraction to block or undercut Trump's efforts to dismantle the Affordable CareAct, deport millions of immigrants in the U.S. illegally and set asideenvironmental protections.Eric Bauman, chairman of the Los Angeles County Democratic Party, called on Gov.Jerry Brown and the California Legislature to "scrub" the state Constitution,laws and statutes to find any legal means available to "protect everyCalifornian" against new conservative policies of the Trump administration.Bauman, who is running to be the next state party chairman, said CaliforniaDemocrats must do everything they can to protect abortion rights, same-sexmarriage and "healthcare for every child, documented or not."Kimberly Ellis of San Francisco, who also is in the running to be the next partychair, dismissed concerns that the party did not do enough nationally to appealto voters won over by Trump, saying "that's not the solution to our long-termproblem."Ellis, executive director of Emerge California, an organization dedicated toincreasing the number of Democratic women in elected office, said that insteadthe party should focus on addressing groups she said are threatened the most bya Trump administration: women, people of color, Muslims, the LGBT community andyoung voters."The Democratic Party, here in California and across the nation, has a lot ofwork to do," Ellis said.--phil.willon@latimes.comTwitter: @philwillon
