Dwight Eisenhower surrounded himself in the White House with such wealthyindividuals that his Cabinet was mockingly referred to as "nine millionaires anda plumber."President-elect Donald Trump is about to do him one better.Trump won the election by appealing to America's disaffected working class,promising to drain the Washington swamp of insiders, and railing againstsegments of the financial elite. But the New York businessman has tapped a slateof people very much in his own vein to serve alongside him -- billionaires andmultimillionaires, including Wall Street financiers, industrialists and scionsof the super-rich."Trump's appointees will probably wind up being the most wealthy group of peoplewho have served in a presidential Cabinet in history," said Robert Spitzer,author of five books on American presidents and chairman of the politicalscience department at SUNY in Cortland, N.Y.Trump's choice for Commerce secretary, investor Wilbur Ross, is worth some $2.5billion by Forbes' account, and Ross' likely deputy, Chicago Cubs co-owner ToddRicketts, is in the billionaires club too. Betsy DeVos, selected to head theDepartment of Education, is a billionaire philanthropist whose husband is heirto the Amway fortune.Banker and movie financier Steven Mnuchin, Trump's pick for Treasury secretary,and others who are key members of Trump's transition team or in the running forstill-unannounced Cabinet posts, including secretaries of State and Energy, areby and large very well off.Spitzer and other scholars note that there is nothing unusual about a presidentappointing rich people to top administration positions. President Obama'sCabinet includes Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker, a billionaire businesswoman.Nor is doing so necessarily an indicator of success or failure. Eisenhower, acareer military man who was not particularly wealthy, liked being aroundself-made people, and is regarded by historians as an effective commander inchief. George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, two of the most highly acclaimedAmerican presidents, were very rich by the standards of their day.Trump stands to become the wealthiest person to occupy the Oval Office, with anet worth estimated by Forbes at $4.5 billion.And just as his wealth did not bother his supporters, many of them don't seem tomind that he is now tapping others from the super-rich club."I'm not surprised he's appointing billionaires. He's going to pick what heknows," said Gayle Stafford, 49, a middle school teacher who lives in a suburbof Cincinnati and voted for Trump. She acknowledged that Trump "talked aboutgetting rid of that kind of thing," but added, "I would hate to classify anyonewho's wealthy as someone who can't get the job done."Of course, today's economic times are different from Eisenhower's, whichlaunched a kind of golden age of broad-based prosperity when there seemed to belittle downside to globalization and technology.The recent decades of manufacturing decline, stagnant earnings and growingincome inequality have hardened feelings that the nation's richest 1%, and thepoliticians who support and protect them, are out of touch with ordinarycitizens and their needs."Part of the point of a diverse Cabinet, besides the PR value -- a Cabinet thatlooks like America -- is the diversity of views and experience it brings,shaping the advice the president gets," said Andrew Rudalevige, professor ofgovernment at Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Maine. "There might not be a varietyof political or policy instincts in a Cabinet of '14 billionaires and amillionaire' -- or however it comes out."Referring to Martin Durkin, Eisenhower's Labor secretary and former head of theplumbers union who was singled out in the old joke as the only nonmillionaire,Rudalevige said,"Trump's picks seem far more ideological. And no plumber yet."Even Stafford said she was worried that DeVos may end up sapping public schoolsin a drive to promote school vouchers and charter schools."She is very wealthy.... She's sent her own kids to private schools," saidStafford, who has 22 years of teaching experience at both public and privateschools. "Is she going to give public schools a chance?"During his campaign, Trump argued his own elite status and wealth actually madehim more qualified to take on the establishment and change the rules that onceserved him.But critics wonder whether Trump's Cabinet choices will share that goal, or betempted to skew policies toward the wealthy, not the working class.Mnuchin this week sought to allay such concerns: "There will be no absolute taxcut for the upper class," he said on CNBC.However, that doesn't square with the tax plan proposed a few months ago byTrump and his economic team -- to cut taxes by roughly $6 trillion over 10years, with a sharp lowering of top tax rates and other changes that wouldlargely benefit corporations and higher-income individuals.Democratic leaders fear that the Trump administration will be overlypro-business and weaken regulations against banks and other firms.Beyond policy, government watchdog and ethics lawyers are concerned that theextraordinary wealth of Trump and his White House create personal temptationsand conflicts. Graft scandals marred Presidents Warren G. Harding and Ulysses S.Grant, whose Cabinets also were stacked with rich individuals.After Watergate there were stronger conflict-of-interest rules for executivebranch officials, including Cabinet members. Trump's appointees would have todivest any holdings relevant to their new jobs and recuse themselves from areaswhere they might have a financial interest."Presidential appointees may not have personal financial interests that will bedirectly and particularly affected in a substantial way by their decisions asgovernment officials," said Robert Lenhard, a senior attorney at Covington &Burling who was a member of the Federal Election Commission in 2006 and 2007.Obama took the additional step of requiring his Cabinet members to resign fromcompany boards they sat on.Former Goldman Sachs chief Henry M. Paulson sold several hundred millions ofdollars in Goldman stock after the Senate confirmed his appointment as PresidentBush's Treasury secretary in 2006, although he also reportedly took advantage ofa tax break designed to make it easier for the rich to accept government jobs,which allowed him to defer paying capital gains when he sold.The rules are likely to trigger extensive vetting of Trump's super-wealthyCabinet members, who will face pressure to step down from corporate boards, selloff certain stock holdings and put assets into blind trusts for the duration oftheir terms.Ross, in particular, faces a lot of work to clear all his financial tie-ups,including board seats and interests with companies involved in banking, energyand transportation. Mnuchin, like Paulson, may have to convert his investmentsinto Treasury notes.The president, however, is exempt from such federal ethics laws. By traditionpresidents in recent decades have put their investments in blind trusts, inwhich stocks and other assets are managed, bought and sold by an independentthird party, without the knowledge of the owner. It is intended to remove theappearance and possibility of self-dealing.Government ethics lawyers and watchdog groups have urged him to sell off hisvast businesses, which include hotels, golf courses and office buildings, andput the assets in a blind trust, but Trump said last week that he had beenturning over operations of his businesses to three of his children, who alreadyhave senior positions at the Trump Organization.And he said this week that on Dec. 15 he would reveal a plan to avoid conflictsof interest while serving as president, although there was no indication that hewas preparing to sell his businesses.Ethics experts and political analysts are already concerned such steps will notgo far enough or set the right example for his Cabinet."Here, the message sent by the person at the top, in this case the president,sets parameters and gives underlings a sense of what is -- and is not --permitted," said Michael Genovese, an American presidency scholar at LoyolaMarymount University in Los Angeles. "President Obama set very strict guidelinesfrom Day One, and emphasized over and over how important it was to not only obeythe law, but do the right thing in the right way. This message filtered down thechain of command, letting everyone know what a top priority honest andtransparent government was. The boss sets the tone for good or ill."Spitzer said Trump's relaxed attitude about his own business dealings may affecthow he views potential conflicts of his Cabinet members."It certainly suggests he will be lenient, tolerant, forgiving of people aroundhim who may be less than scrupulous in maintaining a wall between theirgovernment service and their own private fortunes, private wealth, privatebusiness interests," Spitzer said. "It's a pretty hard wall to police."--don.lee@latimes.comTwitter: @dleelatimes
