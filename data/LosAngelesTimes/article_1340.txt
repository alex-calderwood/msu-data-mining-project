Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton delivered her Nov. 9 concessionspeech in an ensemble so symbolic and so perfectly framed in the TV screen thather message was loud and clear even if you couldn't find the volume knob.Clinton took to the stage wearing a gray Ralph Lauren pantsuit with wide purplepeak lapels and a purple silk charmeuse blouse. Purple, of course, has become asymbol of political unity (or at least balance) in a country that that uses "redstate" and "blue state" as shorthand for the political divisions betweenDemocrat and Republican. Used here as a contrasting color on a dark outfit --black and gray being traditionally associated with mourning -- the message wasunmistakable: Her bid for the White House is over and the country needs to cometogether, not as discrete camps of red or blue but as one wholly combined andcommingled purple country.Purple, we should note, has also long been a color associated with royalty (backin the day it was an exceedingly expensive color to make) and, liturgicallyspeaking (this from my sister-in-law the seminarian), it is the color associatedwith Advent -- the period of reflection, waiting and preparation in many Westernchurches in the run-up to Christ's birth.The defeated Democratic candidate wasn't the only one to opt for a pop of purpleeither; her husband, former President Bill Clinton, was color-coordinated (asymbol of unity in and of itself) with a purple necktie.--adam.tschorn@latimes.comTwitter: @ARTschorn
