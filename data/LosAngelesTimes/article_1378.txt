President-elect Donald Trump reassured voters during his insurgent politicalcampaign that he would protect Medicare, Social Security and other popularfederal assistance programs.But in tapping Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.) to be his Health and Human Servicessecretary, he has elevated one of the most aggressive proponents of dramaticallyoverhauling the government safety net for seniors and low-income Americans, along-held conservative goal.Trump also took a step toward a potentially explosive political battle over theentitlements, which account for close to half of all federal spending.Such a battle -- and the threat of benefit cuts to more than 100 millionAmericans -- risks alienating some of the very working-class voters who fueledTrump's unexpected victory. His advisors and prospective Cabinet already includeseveral figures whose wealth and political connections are at odds with Trump'spopulist rhetoric."The pressure here will ramp up significantly," said John Lawrence, former chiefof staff to House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco), who has lednumerous fights against GOP efforts in recent years to overhaul entitlementprograms.Even the smallest cuts in federal support can spark a backlash, Lawrence added,given people's attachment to Medicare and other programs. "It can be $20, andthey've got serious trouble on their hands," he said.Congressional Republicans voiced strong support Tuesday for Price, whom SenateMajority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) called "the right person to lead thecharge" to repeal Obamacare.But Democrats moved quickly to highlight Price's calls for more far-reachingentitlement changes."Washington Republicans are plotting a war on seniors next year," said Sen.Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), the incoming Senate minority leader.Several Senate Democrats, including red-state lawmakers such as Indiana Sen. JoeDonnelly, announced they would vote against confirming Price. "Tom Price has ledthe charge to privatize Medicare, and for this reason, I cannot support hisnomination," Donnelly said.Trump, in announcing his selection of Price, called the 62-year-old six-termcongressman "exceptionally qualified to shepherd our commitment to repeal andreplace Obamacare and bring affordable and accessible healthcare to everyAmerican."The president-elect did not mention Price's calls for major changes to Medicareand Medicaid, which Price has made a centerpiece of his legislative agenda."Without changing course, America's healthcare system will worsen with time, thenation's federal health programs will either go bankrupt or contribute to thefiscal insolvency of the country at large, and Americans will lose access to thecare they need," Price warned in the 2017 budget blueprint he crafted aschairman of the House Budget Committee.Price, like House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), advocates replacing thegovernment-provided Medicare health plan with a program that provides seniorswith a voucher to purchase private health coverage.This system, which supporters call premium support, saves the federal governmentmoney by gradually shifting costs onto beneficiaries, independent budgetanalyses have shown.Price also advocates a new system of block grants to states that would sharplycut federal aid for Medicaid, which primarily serves poor Americans.Conservatives have argued for decades that Social Security, Medicare andMedicaid, the mammoth government entitlement programs for the elderly, disabledand poor, are unsustainable.But the three entitlements, which cost more than $2 trillion annually, remainextremely popular, unlike the divisive Affordable Care Act, as Obamacare isformally known."Medicare is not seen as the same type of issue as the ACA," Harvard Universitypolitical scientist Robert Blendon, an authority on public opinions ofhealthcare, explained at a recent forum by the Alliance for Health Reform. "Mostvoters of both parties think Medicare is working."Even Medicaid, which began as a welfare program, and the related Children'sHealth Insurance Program have established strong bipartisan support, reflectingin part the large role they play in providing coverage to children and elderlyAmericans in need of nursing home care.Nearly two-thirds of Americans said that Medicaid is a "very important"government program in a 2015 national survey by the nonprofit Kaiser FamilyFoundation. That was only slightly below Medicare, which was rated similarly by77% of Americans, and Social Security, which 83% of respondents said was veryimportant.The depth of that public support has prevented Republicans from making majorchanges to the programs over the years.President George W. Bush's 2005 push to privatize Social Security not only wasdefeated, but helped reenergize Democrats and fueled the party's return to powerin Congress in the 2006 midterm election.Trump appeared to grasp this on the campaign trail.Though he did not discuss healthcare and entitlement policies frequently, Trumpinsisted several times that he would protect programs serving vulnerableAmericans."I'm not going to cut Social Security like every other Republican, and I'm notgoing to cut Medicare or Medicaid," Trump said last year in an interview withthe Daily Signal, an online news site operated by the conservative HeritageFoundation."Every other Republican is going to cut, and even if they wouldn't, they don'tknow what to do because they don't know where the money is. I do," Trump said.But the president-elect has offered few details about his healthcare agenda,including his plans to replace the 2010 Affordable Care Act.And many in Washington are still trying to figure out whether Trump will alignhimself with the conservative governing program that has been championed byPrice, Ryan and other congressional Republicans in recent years."All of Trump's nascent positions were opening gambits in a deal," said RickTyler, who was an aide to former House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.). "It'salways a negotiating position with him."Trump has indicated a willingness to forge an alliance with Democrats overinfrastructure spending, a top policy goal that could find him clashing withfiscal conservatives in his party.That made his choice of Transportation secretary, Elaine Chao, particularlynoteworthy. In addition to serving eight years as Bush's Labor secretary, Chaois married to McConnell, a key negotiator in any spending plans Trump would putforward.Chao's establishment ties conflict with Trump's promise to "drain the swamp" inWashington and promote outsiders to lead his government. But Chao's connectionscould be an asset as he makes the case for fixing dilapidated airports, roadsand bridges.Chao's tenure at the Department of Labor included criticism from some advocatesthat she sided with employers on enforcing safety standards and failed toadequately protect low-wage workers. Chao rejected those assertions.The pick was greeted with cautious optimism by Democratic leaders. Schu-mer saidDemocrats were eager to work with Chao "if President-elect Trump is seriousabout a major infrastructure bill, backed by real dollars and not just taxcredits and without cutting other programs like healthcare and education."Trump made another overture to an establishment figure Tuesday when he and hisdesignated chief of staff, Reince Priebus, dined with their party's 2012presidential nominee, Mitt Romney. It was Trump's second meeting with Romney,who is said to be under consideration as secretary of State.They met at Jean-Georges, a high-priced restaurant alongside Central Park in NewYork. Asked by a reporter how the dinner was going, Trump flashed a thumbs-up.--noam.levey@latimes.comTwitter: @noamleveynoah.bierman@latimes.comTwitter: @noahbierman
