In the summer of 2013, as state and federal officials readied new insurancemarketplaces created through the Affordable Care Act, millions of Americansstarted getting disquieting notices from their insurers.Health plans were being canceled because they didn't comply with the law, oftencalled Obamacare.Some 4 million people were ultimately told they would lose their plans. Theensuing outrage sparked a political firestorm, seriously eroded publicconfidence in Obamacare and forced an embarrassed President Obama to changefederal regulations so people could keep their coverage.Yet that tumultuous episode could be dwarfed by what President-elect DonaldTrump's administration and its congressional allies unleash beginning next year.They not only plan to repeal the law but are contemplating changes that aresignificantly more far-reaching and could disrupt insurance coverage for manymore Americans than did the original law."There is significant risk of chaos," said Ian Morrison, a healthcare consultantwho advises health systems nationwide. "If they don't get this right, a lot ofpeople will suffer."Avoiding major instability has become a central focus for senior Republicansscrambling to plot a healthcare strategy since the party's sweeping electionvictories, according to GOP lawmakers, current and former congressional staffmembers and health industry officials.But it won't be easy, given the sheer number of people who may be affected.About 11 million Americans, most of whom get government subsidies to offsettheir insurance premiums, depend on insurance marketplaces created by the healthlaw that Republicans have proposed eliminating.Additionally, approximately 75 million poor Americans are enrolled in either theChildren's Health Insurance Program or Medicaid, which would be scaled back inmost GOP health plans.House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) has indicated he also wants to overhaulMedicare, which provides coverage to more than 50 million elderly and disabledAmericans."Any time a party has been out of power ... there is an instinct to try to doeverything as rapidly as possible and to do it in a way that satisfies theirappetite for change," said former Utah Gov. Mike Leavitt, who served as Healthand Human Services secretary under President George W. Bush."There is a real need here not to overreach and not to move too fast," Leavittcautioned.Yet across the country, hospitals, doctors, insurers and others are deeplyanxious."Perhaps Congress can lead us in a direction where we fix the things that arewrong with the ACA, because there are many, and preserve what is good," saidSheryl Skolnick, research director at investment bank Mizuho Securities USA."From where I sit, I think it's a very risky bet."Several senior Republican senators in recent days have emphasized that they wantto avoid turmoil."Congress will make sure that the transition is a smooth one for Americans,"said Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), who leads the Senate Republican PolicyCommittee. "People have already faced too much disruption in their healthcaredue to Obamacare."To reduce potential chaos, congressional Republicans have been discussing amultistep, multiyear process for repealing and replacing the health law.They would vote early next year on legislation that would scrap large parts ofthe law, including the unpopular insurance mandate and funding for insurancesubsidies and for Medicaid expansions that 31 states have enacted.That legislation would delay the effective date of the repeal for a year or two,however, giving Republicans time to develop an alternative.Although this "repeal and delay" strategy may not jeopardize coverageimmediately for Americans who gained it through the health law, it coulddestabilize insurance marketplaces.Many insurers in the marketplaces have been losing money, in large part becauseconsumers who signed up for coverage were sicker than anticipated.Insurers remained in hope that the marketplaces would be stabilized by the nextadministration. But if the marketplaces are being eliminated, many insurerswould probably reevaluate, according to industry officials and healthcareexperts.If insurers walk away, millions of consumers would be forced to switch plans orpay big premium increases, reprising the kind of turmoil that occurred in 2013,but potentially on a larger scale.Although consumer frustration with premiums and other problems has intensifiedthis year, polls show most marketplace users are satisfied. More than two-thirdsrated their coverage as "excellent" or "good" in a nationwide survey this yearby the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation."The markets already were somewhat fragile," said Larry Levitt, senior vicepresident of the foundation. "It was likely going to take a concerted effort ...to put marketplaces in many states on firmer footing."The Trump administration could take steps to solidify the marketplaces in theshort term, which would probably include bolstering a controversial program topay insurers that sustained heavy losses on the marketplaces.But that program is a political lightning rod for Republicans, who accused theObama administration of giving a bailout to insurance companies.Congressional Republicans have also attacked the current administration forproviding financial assistance to low-income marketplace consumers to help thempay deductibles and co-pays, arguing that the money was not appropriated byCongress.If the Trump administration stops those payments, as some conservatives haveadvocated, many more insurers would probably cancel their health plans.Whether they would return will depend on what kind of replacement Republicansdevelop.GOP officials have expressed confidence that plans they have developed in recentyears, including a 37-page blueprint that House Republicans released thissummer, give them a strong foundation for enacting a replacement.But that plan -- which includes a Medicare overhaul that would shift futurebeneficiaries into a new system that gives them vouchers to shop for privatehealth plans -- would probably extend the disruptions years further.Trump transition officials have not detailed any of the new administration'shealthcare plans."This is an area that is very fraught and very difficult because the policy iscomplicated," said Dean Rosen, who served as healthcare advisor to former SenateMajority Leader Bill Frist (R-Tenn)."It is one thing when you are painting on a blank canvas. It is another when youare taking down someone's version of the Mona Lisa and trying to put upsomething that you think is better."--noam.levey@latimes.com
