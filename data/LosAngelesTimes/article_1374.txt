President-elect Donald Trump not only alleged widespread national voter fraud ina series of messages posted on Twitter on Sunday, but took the time in one tweetto target the ballots cast in California as an example of the problem.Trump called the fraud "serious" in the state, along with Virginia and NewHampshire, and blamed media "bias" for the lack of coverage the allegations havereceived.It was the first time the president-elect has specifically voiced concerns aboutvoting in California. The tweet came in the wake of several days of criticismfrom both Trump and his advisors over an effort by the Green Party to force arecount of votes cast in Wisconsin and possibly Michigan and Pennsylvania.The tweet, posted on Sunday afternoon, was met with condemnation from thestate's top elections official."It appears that Mr. Trump is troubled by the fact that a growing majority ofAmericans did not vote for him," Secretary of State Alex Padilla, a Democrat,said in a statement. "His unsubstantiated allegations of voter fraud inCalifornia and elsewhere are absurd. His reckless tweets are inappropriate andunbecoming of a president-elect."Elections officials in the state's 58 counties have not yet finished countingthe ballots cast this month, but there's no doubt Trump was trounced by DemocratHillary Clinton. In returns as of Saturday night that add to mounting evidenceof just how far out of reach the state is for Republicans, Clinton was ahead bymore than 3.9 million votes.The president-elect's Sunday comments are not in line with any reporting orinvestigations into intentional acts in California designed to influence theoutcome of the vote. Even so, the concern for voting integrity was echoed by atop state Republican."I just think our system is ripe for fraud in California," said Harmeet Dhillon,the former vice chair of the California Republican Party and current RepublicanNational Committee member.Dhillon said she had not seen evidence of a systemic effort to rig California'selections, but said Republicans had often raised concerns about electionoperations.In particular, she criticized the state's relatively new law that requires thecounting of any absentee ballot postmarked by election day and arriving as longas three days late. She said it was possible a ballot envelope could bepostmarked using a private postage meter that had been set to Nov. 8 but wascast the next day."The word 'postmarked' is not clear in the law," said Dhillon, a San Franciscoattorney.But any such incident would be too isolated to sway a statewide election such asthe presidential contest. Trump's accusation, offered as so many of his tweetswithout any further explanation or substantiation, stood in contrast to whatotherwise at this point are only a series of vignettes about ballot or electionmistakes in California."Broad-brush allegations of voter fraud and illegal voting serve only toundermine the public's trust and confidence in the elections process and run therisk of further deflating voter participation," said Dean Logan, registrar ofvoters in Los Angeles County and president of the statewide association ofelections officials.Unlike other states, elections observers point out, California has a series ofsafeguards built into the systems used by individual counties and overseen bystate officials.Those include voter-verified paper records for any ballots cast by electronicdevice (though the preponderance of votes are now cast using optical-scanballots) and a 51-year-old law requiring an audit of the results in all races byhand-counting 1% of the ballots in each precinct across the state."California has the most robust voting verification laws of any state in thecountry," said Kim Alexander, president of the nonpartisan California VoterFoundation.In the almost three weeks following Trump's election, numerous online posts havealleged -- with no actual evidence -- voter fraud in various places across thecountry, often tied to allegations that those votes came from immigrants in theU.S. illegally.Even so, Dhillon said the integrity of elections in California and across thenation is a serious issue that Trump is trying to highlight."I think a single fraudulent ballot is a serious instance of fraud," she said.--john.myers@latimes.comTwitter: @johnmyers
