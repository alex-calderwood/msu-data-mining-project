Donald Trump's trip to Indiana on Thursday showcased him as the president hepromised he'd be: a benevolent billionaire working successfully to salvagealmost 1,000 American jobs that had been destined to move to Mexico before heinterceded.Trump has honed that image daily with his effervescent use of social media. Buthis energetic efforts have also obscured some of the conversation about theadministration he is building and whether it plays against his populist posture.Joy over the cancellation of a plan by the Carrier air conditioning and heatingfirm to move its jobs outpaced questions about the costs of saving them,including the millions in taxpayer money that went to the company.Similarly, Trump's tweeting about persuading Carrier, and about separatinghimself from his namesake real estate company, overshadowed developments such aspicking a Goldman Sachs veteran as his Treasury secretary and stocking hisCabinet with officials who have pledged to do away with programs relied on bymany Trump voters. And particularly with the business announcement, Trump putoff mounting questions by promising to address them later, delaying specificswhile ensuring future attention on whatever he decides.All presidents work to cast events in their best possible light. In pastadministrations, such image-making would have been orchestrated by messageexperts, speechwriters and video teams.Trump has so far accomplished it mostly with two thumbs and his Twitter account.Thursday's trip to Indianapolis marked his first significant public appearancesince his visit to the White House two days after the election."What Trump seems to have figured out is the same audience that's willing toaccept a message in 140 characters in every other aspect of their lives is alsowilling to accept it when it comes to politics," said Dan Schnur, a presidentialcampaign veteran who now directs USC's Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics. "Heseems to have decided that the best way to avoid a controversy is to createanother controversy."Trump's transition has emphasized approach over policy. The policy willinevitably flow once his Cabinet and administration are fully stocked, but itseems unlikely that he will dramatically change his own bent.After appearing in Indiana, Trump headed to a rally in Cincinnati, the first ofseveral in states that flipped from Democratic to Republican in 2016, deliveringhim the presidency.It's something of a luxury for him to crisscross the country. Unlike during thelast presidential transition, the economy is not cratering, uneven though it maybe. The nearly 1,000 jobs Trump credited to himself and Vice President-electMike Pence, while hugely important to the workers and the surroundingcommunities, are a smidge of the 11 million gained under President Obama'snearly eight-year tenure.The decision by Carrier followed its talks with Trump and Pence, the Indianagovernor until January. To hear him tell it Thursday, Trump didn't rememberpromising to save the jobs until he recently watched a television news clip of aworker relating his pledge. Most of the time, Carrier had simply been a campaigntarget, its officials cast as greedy outsourcers of the sort he would deal withharshly after he became president.The company appeared to have canceled some of the planned job shifts because ofthe combination of tax breaks and fears by its parent company, UnitedTechnologies, that its federal government contracts might be at risk.The targeting of one company is precisely the criticism that Republicans havelong made of Obama, whom they regarded as picking economic winners and losersbased on ideology.Trump's plans regarding his role in his own company won't be known until a Dec.15 news conference.He first said he "will be leaving [his] great business in total" to "in no wayhave a conflict of interest with [his] various businesses."But then he said he was preparing legal documents that would take him"completely out of business operations" -- suggesting that his children wouldrun the company, but that he could retain his ownership interest.Already the Trump children have been heavily involved in the transition, andthey and he have conducted meetings that commingled their business ambitionswith his presidential plans.The Carrier and Trump Organization announcements took the focus off actions thatflew in the face of the harshly anti-Wall Street campaign rhetoric that soentranced his supporters.At campaign rallies, thousands jeered his contention that Hillary Clinton was inthe pocket of Goldman Sachs. A late-campaign ad showed a picture of ChiefExecutive Lloyd Blankfein, as the narrator declared that Goldman was one of ahandful of corporations that "robbed our working class."But this week, Trump named Goldman veteran -- and campaign finance chairman --Steven Mnuchin as his choice for Treasury secretary. Another former Goldmanemployee, Stephen K. Bannon, will be Trump's chief strategist. The company'spresident, Gary Cohn, visited Trump Tower amid word that he might head Trump'sbudget office.It's not unusual for executives from Goldman or similar companies to takehigh-ranking government jobs, but it was bracing coming from a candidate whoseelection was powered by antipathy toward elites.Both Mnuchin and Trump's prospective Commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, areexpected to face congressional scrutiny over past deals that either cost jobsor, in Mnuchin's case, led to tens of thousands of foreclosures during thehousing crisis.Trump spokesman Jason Miller brushed aside any dissonance."The president-elect has done a fantastic job of putting together a Cabinet ofwinners," he said.Neither selection is expected to stumble, given Republican control over thenomination process.Trump does seem to have some room for maneuvering given the enthusiasm of hissupporters. He also has a record of ignoring or upending the conventions of acampaign, and now those of a transition.Since his election, he has cast aside the typical mode in which sober, privatereflection leads to a formal announcement of appointments. In its stead is afreewheeling, Twitter-driven grab bag in which few are sure whether policies areholding or changing, or whether he's inviting people in for vetting, foradvising or to display contrition. The transition has been as much reality showas staid government."Trump has decided that talking about these things in public doesn't lookindecisive but it builds suspense," Schnur said."In the political world, that is absolutely revolutionary. On the other hand,it's exactly what they do on 'American Idol.' He's just building interest innext week's show."--cathleen.decker@latimes.com
