HIGHLIGHT:Â Rights and privacy of the undocumented will be protected, systemsays.Campus police departments will not cooperate with law enforcement agencieslooking to arrest those who have broken federal immigration laws, the Universityof California system announced Wednesday in response to President-elect DonaldTrump's pledge to ramp up deportations.UC's 10 campuses will protect the privacy and civil rights of undocumentedstudents and will continue to welcome and support students, regardless ofimmigration status.In the statement of its policy regarding undocumented immigrants, the UC systemalso said its hospitals, which serve the public, will "vigorously enforceuniversity nondiscrimination and privacy policies" in treating patients."While we still do not know what policies and practices the incoming federaladministration may adopt, given the many public pronouncements made during thepresidential campaign and its aftermath, we felt it necessary to reaffirm thatUC will act upon its deeply held conviction that all members of our communityhave the right to work, study and live safely and without fear at all UClocations," UC President Janet Napolitano said in a release.Anita Casavantes Bradford, who heads UC Irvine's Committee on Equity andInclusion for Undocumented Students, said she was reassured by Napolitano'sstatement."They are among our most talented, motivated and engaged students," she said."They are an important asset to our university and our communities, and I'm gladthat President Napolitano has shown, through her principled statement andactions, that she also recognizes the contributions that undocumented youngpeople and their families make to our state."Across the country, a wave of campus protests and petitions are calling forsanctuary campuses and the protection of students brought to the countryillegally as children. Trump has pledged to abolish a program created byPresident Barack Obama that offers those students temporary legal residence anda work permit. Napolitano signed the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals,known as DACA, in 2012 as secretary of the Department of Homeland Security.Those who oppose illegal immigration were not pleased to hear of the UC system'sstand."It's radical and leftist policies like this UC announcement that caused votersto reject the Democrats on Nov. 8 and put Trump into the White House," said JohnBerry of the Redlands Tea Party Patriots. "Students here illegally should bedeported. ... Those classroom seats should be saved for people in the U.S.legally."Karthick Ramakrishnan, a UC Riverside public policy professor, said the UCsystem's statement giving specifics on what it will not do is stronger thancalling campuses a sanctuary - a concept, he said, that can be interpretedvarious ways."What's interesting in this moment," Ramakrishnan said, "is that universitiesare taking a moral stand about what is important in terms of the educationalmission and their duties of providing to students regardless of theirimmigration status."
