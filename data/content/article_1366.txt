Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign will participate in an effort led byGreen Party candidate Jill Stein to recount ballots in Wisconsin and perhaps twoother battleground states that were crucial to Donald Trump's victory, a Clintoncampaign lawyer said Saturday.In response, Trump called the recount request "ridiculous" and a "scam" designedto raise money for Stein's political party.In a blog post, Clinton lawyer Marc Elias said her team had not planned toparticipate in a recount, noting that inquiries over the last two weeks had not"uncovered any actionable evidence of hacking or outside attempts to alter thevoting technology" that affected the final tally in Wisconsin, Michigan orPennsylvania.Elias downplayed any notion that a recount would change the results, noting thatthe number of votes separating Trump and Clinton in Michigan -- the closest ofthe three states -- vastly exceeds the largest margin ever overcome in astatewide recount.Preelection polls had shown Clinton leading in all three states. Trump won themby a combined margin of 107,000 votes."But regardless of the potential to change the outcome in any of the states, wefeel it is important, on principle, to ensure our campaign is legallyrepresented in any court proceedings and represented on the ground in order tomonitor the recount process itself," he wrote.In his statement, Trump aimed his fire at Stein, not Clinton."This count is just a way for Jill Stein, who received less than one percent ofthe vote overall and wasn't even on the ballot in many states, to fill hercoffers with money, most of which she will never even spend on this ridiculousrecount," Trump said.Stein, in fact, received at least 1% of the overall vote. She was on the ballotin 44 states and the District of Columbia and was eligible as a write-incandidate in three other states.Trump continued: "This is a scam by the Green Party for an election that hasalready been conceded, and the results of this election should be respectedinstead of being challenged and abused, which is exactly what Jill Stein isdoing."Elias said that the Clinton campaign had "quietly taken a number of steps in thelast two weeks to rule in or out any possibility of outside interference" andthat others have "expended time and effort to investigate various claims ofabnormalities and irregularities.""While that effort has not, in our view, resulted in evidence of manipulation ofresults, now that a recount is underway, we believe we have an obligation to themore than 64 million Americans who cast ballots for Hillary Clinton toparticipate in ongoing proceedings to ensure that an accurate vote count will bereported," Elias said.Stein filed for a recount in Wisconsin on Friday. The filing deadline for arecount has passed in Pennsylvania, so she will have to challenge that state'sresults in court to proceed. In Michigan, Stein has to wait until Monday for thecertification of the results."If Jill Stein follows through as she has promised and pursues recounts inPennsylvania and Michigan, we will take the same approach in those states aswell," Elias said in the blog post.On Friday, the Obama administration said in a statement that it was "confidentin the overall integrity of electoral infrastructure" and it defended theintegrity of the election results as representing the will of the Americanpeople.Although the administration warned in early October that Russian hackers wereseeking to interfere with the campaign by leaking emails stolen from DemocraticParty leaders and Clinton's aides, the White House said Friday that "we believeour elections were free and fair from a cybersecurity perspective."During the campaign, Clinton sharply criticized Trump for refusing to say hewould accept the election results if she won. She conceded her loss to Trumphours after polls had closed on election day and congratulated him.As of Saturday afternoon, Stein's fundraising drive had brought in about $5.8million to support the cost of the recounts, with a goal of $7 million,according to her website.--don.lee@latimes.comTwitter: @dleelatimes
