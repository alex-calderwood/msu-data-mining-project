LettersCoulter instead of PittsOne doesn't have to read many opinion pieces by your desired columnist LeonardPitts to conclude he is a hate-filled Democrat loser. His columns, before andafter the election, are shining examples. His columns incite and give a voice todivisive political and racial antipathy.The election of Donald Trump is a fitting rebuke of Obama, his policies andliberalism in general. There is no other way to look at it.Conservative columnist and best-selling author Ann Coulter, viciously hated byliberals because she tells the truth about them, would be a fitting replacementfor "deniers" like Pitts. She endorsed Trump the day after he announced hispresidential bid in June 2015 and was widely ridiculed by "the smirking class."Her best-selling book, "In Trump We Trust," written before his nomination,presciently outlines why Trump's campaign resonated with "the working class."She's "too controversial"? She's had the last laugh!"Are we that country?" Yes, Leonard, we're Pitts offed.John WeisenburgerSpokaneFind common groundThe misrepresentations and lies from both sides of the political spectrum aregetting tiresome, especially since we as a people have more in common than wehave apart.Trump won the presidency. For whatever reasons, Hillary lost. Trump's presidencyis legitimate and is no less so because he did not get the votes from themajority. He won an Electoral College election, not a popular vote election.This is not the first time the presidency was awarded to the person who failedto win the majority, and as it is developing, Hillary Clinton is on track tohave the historically largest number of votes for the loser of a presidentialelection.We are all Americans and we are all in this together. As President Obamasuccinctly put it, we are all on the same team. We need to find common groundwhere we can and resist all forms of intolerance as we must.Harvey McKelveyNewman LakeStriking backReflecting on the recent election, it is tempting to use a "Star Wars" analogyand conclude that we are in Episode V, where the empire strikes back and DarthVader has just become the president. However, many "Star Wars" fans will accuseme of insulting Darth Vader, who was far more intellectually honest than TheDonald seems to be.Since the political life of this country is a pendulum, it will inevitably swingback once the force, which was tapped by Bernie Sanders, fully awakens.However, if the Jedi are to succeed in regaining the high ground, we will haveto remember the words of Yoda when he was coaching Luke Skywalker. Luke wastasked with raising his ship from the swamp and he said, "I'll try." Yodaresponded, "There is no try - there is only do or not do." So, come on, people,let's do this.Daniel SchafferSpokanetext/cci-newsdesk
