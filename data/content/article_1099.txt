HIGHLIGHT: The alt-right, an extremist fringe popular with white supremacists,has celebrated the election of Donald J. Trump, and now hopes to have the ear ofhis White House.Correction AppendedWASHINGTON - By the time Richard B. Spencer, the leading ideologue of thealt-right movement and the final speaker of the night, rose to address agathering of his followers on Saturday, the crowd was restless.In 11 hours of speeches and panel discussions in a federal building named afterRonald Reagan a few blocks from the White House, a succession of speakers hadlaid out a harsh vision for the future, but had denounced violence and said thatHispanic citizens and black Americans had nothing to fear. Earlier in the day,Mr. Spencer himself had urged the group to start acting less like an undergroundorganization and more like the establishment.But now his tone changed as he began to tell the audience of more than 200people, mostly young men, what they had been waiting to hear. He railed againstJews and, with a smile, quoted Nazi propaganda in the original German. America,he said, belonged to white people, whom he called the "children of the sun," arace of conquerors and creators who had been marginalized but now, in the era ofPresident-elect Donald J. Trump, were "awakening to their own identity."As he finished, several audience members had their arms outstretched in a Nazisalute. Mr. Spencer called out: "Hail Trump! Hail our people!" and then, "Hailvictory!" - the English translation of the Nazi exhortation "Sieg Heil!" Theroom shouted back.These are exultant times for the alt-right movement, which was little knownuntil this year, when it embraced Mr. Trump's campaign and he appeared toembrace it back. He chose as his campaign chairman Stephen K. Bannon, the mediaexecutive who ran the alt-right's most prominent platform, Breitbart News, andthen named him as a senior adviser and chief strategist.Now the movement's leaders hope to have, if not a seat at the table, at leastthe ear of the Trump White House.While many of its racist views are well known - that President Obama is, or mayas well be, of foreign birth; that the Black Lives Matter movement is anothername for black race rioters; that even the American-born children ofundocumented Hispanic immigrants should be deported - the alt-right has beendifficult to define. Is it a name for right-wing political provocateurs in theinternet era? Or is it a political movement defined by xenophobia and a dislikefor political correctness?At the conference on Saturday, Mr. Spencer, who said he had coined the term,defined the alt-right as a movement with white identity as its core idea."We've crossed the Rubicon in terms of recognition," Mr. Spencer said at theconference, which was sponsored by his organization, the National PolicyInstitute.And while much of the discourse at the conference was overtly racist anddemeaning toward minorities, for much of the day the sentiments were expressedin ways that seemed intended to not sound too menacing. The focus was on howwhites were marginalized and beleaguered.One speaker, Peter Brimelow, the founder of Vdare.com, an anti-immigrationwebsite, asked why, if Hispanics had the National Council of La Raza and Jewshad the Anti-Defamation League, whites were reluctant to organize for theirrights. Some speakers made an effort to distance themselves from more notoriouswhite power organizations like the Ku Klux Klan.But as the night wore on and most reporters had gone home, the language changed.Mr. Spencer's after-dinner speech began with a polemic against the "mainstreammedia," before he briefly paused. "Perhaps we should refer to them in theoriginal German?" he said.The audience immediately screamed back, "Lügenpresse," reviving a Nazi-era wordthat means "lying press."Mr. Spencer suggested that the news media had been critical of Mr. Trumpthroughout the campaign in order to protect Jewish interests. He mused about thepolitical commentators who gave Mr. Trump little chance of winning."One wonders if these people are people at all, or instead soulless golem," hesaid, referring to a Jewish fable about the golem, a clay giant that a rabbibrings to life to protect the Jews.Mr. Trump's election, Mr. Spencer said, was "the victory of will," a phrase thatechoed the title of the most famous Nazi-era propaganda film. But Mr. Spencerthen mentioned, with a smile, Theodor Herzl, the Zionist leader who advocated aJewish homeland in Israel, quoting his famous pronouncement, "If we will it, itis no dream."The United States today, Mr. Spencer said, had been turned into "a sick,corrupted society." But it was not supposed to be that way."America was, until this last generation, a white country designed for ourselvesand our posterity," Mr. Spencer thundered. "It is our creation, it is ourinheritance, and it belongs to us."But the white race, he added, is "a race that travels forever on an upwardpath.""To be white is to be a creator, an explorer, a conqueror," he said.More members of the audience were on their feet as Mr. Spencer described thechoice facing white people as to "conquer or die."Of other races, Mr. Spencer said: "We don't exploit other groups, we don't gainanything from their presence. They need us, and not the other way around."The ties between the alt-right movement and the Trump team are difficult todefine, even by members of the alt-right.Mr. Bannon was the chief executive of Breitbart, an online news organizationthat has fed the lie that Mr. Obama is a Kenyan-born Muslim. As recently as lastyear, Breitbart published an op-ed article urging that "every tree, everyrooftop, every picket fence, every telegraph pole in the South should befestooned with the Confederate battle flag."Mr. Bannon told Mother Jones this year that Breitbart was now "the platform forthe alt-right."But in an interview last week with The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Bannon said thatthe alt-right was only "a tiny part" of the viewpoint represented on Breitbart."Our definition of the alt-right is younger people who are anti-globalists, verynationalist, terribly anti-establishment," he told The Journal, adding that thealt-right had "some racial and anti-Semitic overtones."When asked about Mr. Bannon, the conference's speakers said that they might haveshaken his hand on occasion, but that they did not know him well.Mr. Brimelow said that he had met "Mr. Bannon once, earlier this summer, beforehe ascended to Olympus." He said he had told Mr. Bannon that he was doing greatwork at Breitbart. "He agreed," Mr. Brimelow recalled to the audience.As for Mr. Trump, Mr. Brimelow said he had met him about 30 years ago at a"conservative affinity meeting" in Manhattan. But that was it."Trump and Steve Bannon are not alt-right people," Mr. Brimelow said, addingthat they had opportunistically seized on two issues that the alt-right caresmost about - stopping immigration and fighting political correctness - and usedthem to mobilize white voters.Mr. Spencer said that while he did not think the president-elect should beconsidered alt-right, "I do think we have a psychic connection, or you can say adeeper connection, with Donald Trump in a way that we simply do not have withmost Republicans."White identity, he said, is at the core of both the alt-right movement and theTrump movement, even if most voters for Mr. Trump "aren't willing to articulateit as such."At various points, he and other speakers outlined where they differed from Mr.Trump. They see him as too beholden to Israel. They do not see any reason tostart a trade war with China, and they are not necessarily opposed to the Irannuclear deal.For them, immigration is the most potent mobilizing issue, less for economicreasons than because of the prospect that white Americans will someday representless than half of the population of the country.For the alt-right, the most exciting thing about Mr. Trump was that he built acampaign around the issues that mattered most to them, and that white people hadvoted for him in numbers that left the political establishments of both partiesstunned. Now, Mr. Spencer said, it is up to the alt-right to formulate the ideasand policies to guide the new administration."I think we can be the ones out in front, thinking about those things he hasn'tquite grasped yet, who are putting forward policies," Mr. Spencer said, that"have a realistic chance of being implemented."Correction: November 24, 2016, ThursdayThis article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article onMonday described a speech in Washington by Richard B. Spencer, president of thewhite-nationalist National Policy Institute. At the end of the speech, Mr.Spencer and audience members shouted versions of Nazi slogans, as some audiencemembers raised their arms in the Nazi salute.A Times reporter in the hall heard audience members shout "Heil victory!" andother exhortations. A video of the scene, released after the article waspublished, showed that Mr. Spencer himself shouted "Hail victory!" - the Englishtranslation of the Nazis' "Sieg Heil!" - as well as "Hail Trump! " and "Hail ourpeople!" (Mr. Spencer did not use the German "Heil," as the original articlesuggested.)PHOTOS: Protesters in Washington on Saturday outside a conference where RichardB.
