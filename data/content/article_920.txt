On the top row are Tiffany and his sons Donald Jr.and Eric.Chris Albert/CBS NewsOne day after President-elect Donald Trump's daughter Ivanka spoke to "60Minutes" about her father's rise to power, her jewelry line alerted journaliststo a surprising fact: The incoming first daughter was wearing an Ivanka TrumpFine Jewelry-brand bracelet, which could be bought for $10,800.It was the first televised interview with the  incoming commander in chief of adeeply anxious America. Part of the segment also included members of his family.But it was also, for the Trump company, an undeniable promotional opportunity.The 18-karat Metropolis diamond bangle, a gold version of which sold for $8,800,was Ivanka's "favorite bangle," a company vice president told journalists in a"style alert."The sales tactic marked one of the first moments since the election during whichthe Trump companies have sought to use Trump's presidential prominence to boosttheir private fortunes.But it may not be the last.Ethics advisers have increasingly voiced concerns over the unprecedentedconflicts of interest that could arise from the soon-to-be first family's empireof real estate, luxury goods and licensing deals."This will keep a spotlight on the family business, on the members of thefamily, how they run the business and their interactions with the government,"said Jan Witold Baran, a partner at Washington law firm Wiley Rein. "Familymembers can create problems all on their own."Abigail Klem, president of the Ivanka Trump brand, said the notification aboutthe bracelet "was sent by a well-intentioned marketing employee at one of ourcompanies who was following customary protocol, and who, like many of us, isstill making adjustments post-election. We are proactively discussing newpolicies and procedures with all of our partners going forward."Ivanka Trump has said she wants to stay involved in her business and is notinterested in an official role in her father's administration. But officialssaid Ivanka and her siblings will have influential roles in deciding the playersand policies of Trump's time in office.The presidential campaign was a ripe time for Trump corporate marketing.In July, Ivanka Trump's fashion line advertised on Twitter that shoppers couldbuy the dress she wore during her Republican National Convention speech. Thewebsites of Macy's and Nordstrom later that day said the dress was sold out.In the first months of Trump's campaign, revenue at his palatial Florida resort,Mar-a-Lago, nearly doubled.Conflict-of-interest laws do not block a president or his family from involvingthemselves in matters that could boost their private companies' wealth orprominence. But the promotional spots since Trump's electoral victory reveal themany potential entanglements that could influence his  presidency.Trump has resisted the tradition set by most presidents before him of selling orhanding over his assets into a "blind trust" controlled by an independentmanager.He said he intends to give control of his companies to Ivanka and his otherchildren, an arrangement that ethics experts say does little to put distancebetween Trump's presidential decision-making and personal estate.During the "60 Minutes" interview, Ivanka Trump sought to maintain herconnection to the licensing and merchandising deals she had forged as abusinesswoman.When asked whether she would assume a role in Trump's White House, Ivanka Trumpsaid she would not, adding: "I'm going to be a daughter. But I've saidthroughout the campaign that I am very passionate about certain issues and Iwant to fight for them."There are a lot of things that I feel really strongly about, but not in aformal administrative capacity."Alan Garten, an executive vice president and general counsel with the TrumpOrganization, said in September that Trump would take "significant steps toavoid even the appearance of impropriety."Trump has given no indication how he will handle ongoing litigation against hisbusiness interests including, most immediately, a fraud lawsuit against thenow-defunct Trump University real estate seminars that is scheduled to go totrial Nov. 28 in California.Trump is also named personally as a defendant in the suit, which alleges thatcustomers who paid for the program were duped by claims that Trump hadhandpicked seminar instructors.Trump's lawyers have asked to delay the start of the trial until after hisinauguration, citing the "momentous, exceedingly complex" task of building agovernment and preparing to take office. Lawyers for former Trump Universitycustomers have opposed the motion, arguing Trump will only become more busyafter he takes office.U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel - whom Trump had accused during the campaignof being biased because of his Mexican heritage - on Tuesday ordered both sidesto present their arguments regarding the delay at a hearing Friday.Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, one of Trump's fiercest surrogates,defended Trump's conflict-of-interest decisions Sunday, saying that followingthe traditions of past presidents would unfairly penalize the Trump family."He would basically put his children out of work if - and they'd have to gostart a whole new business, and that would set up the whole - set up newproblems," Giuliani told CNN.Trump's globe-spanning network of business interests has sparked new questionsover the independence of his domestic policy-making and foreign negotiations.Trump companies are partially indebted to major banks in Germany and China, andTrump wrote in financial-disclosure filings that he is involved in more than 500companies, some of them found in diplomatically sensitive countries such asAzerbaijan and Saudi Arabia.
