A Supreme Court dispute over the government's power to indefinitely jailimmigrants facing deportation has taken on added significance with the electionof Donald Trump, who has vowed to remove millions of foreigners in the countryillegally.The case, to be argued Wednesday, pits civil libertarians and federal judges inCalifornia against the Obama administration, which is defending the government'sbroad power in dealing with immigration.At issue is whether immigrants fighting deportation have a legal right to a bondhearing and possible release if they are held more than six months whileawaiting resolution of their case. The immigrants involved include longtimelegal residents as well as some here illegally.Civil libertarians say indefinitely holding such immigrants violates the 5thAmendment guarantee that "no person shall be ... deprived of ... liberty ...without due process of law." In the past, the court has said the word "person"includes immigrants as well as citizens.They also argue that many of these immigrants have lived and worked legally inthe United States and are being held for long periods over minor or nonviolentoffenses, including simple drug possession.Government lawyers counter that federal law mandates that noncitizens convictedof crimes "shall be detained."In the past, the Supreme Court has been closely split on rights for immigrants.In 2001, the justices said the Constitution "entitles aliens to due process oflaw in deportation proceedings." By a 5-4 vote, however, they said foreignersfacing possible deportation may "be detained for the brief period" required todecide their immigration case.More recently, federal appeals court judges in California and New York have setsix months as the limit for what that "brief period" may constitute. The casebefore the high court involves a ruling by the U.S. 9th Circuit Court ofAppeals, which upheld a judge's order in Los Angeles that required thegovernment to give a bond hearing to deportable immigrants who are held in jailfor more than six months.Civil liberties advocates say that without a limit of that sort, the governmentcould wield the threat of indefinite detention against immigrants who might bepressured to simply give up and return home rather than spend years behind barsawaiting resolution.The case has drawn greater attention since Trump's election and may well portendsome of the legal battles ahead under his administration. In his first TVinterview after the election, Trump spoke of arresting and deporting 2 millionto 3 million foreigners who have criminal records."What we're going to do is get the people that are criminal and have criminalrecords -- gang members, drug dealers. We have a lot of these people, probably 2million. It could be even 3 million. We are getting them out of our country," hetold CBS' "60 Minutes."Immigration experts say that number is not limited to people who have committedfelonies or violent crimes, but includes many with lesser offenses, includingtraffic violations. To carry out such deportations, federal agents wouldprobably prefer to have a free hand to arrest and keep these immigrants in jail.Officials with Trump's transition team did not respond to a request for comment.Legal experts say a Supreme Court ruling upholding the president's power todetain immigrants indefinitely would give the new administration greaterleverage in cracking down against illegal immigration."I thought this case was important before, but obviously it is more importantwith an administration that wants to do even more deportations," said KarenTumlin, legal director for the National Immigration Law Center in Los Angeles."You would think mandatory detention is for people with very severe crimes, butit is not. It can be for relatively low-level charges."Each day, more than 40,000 people are held in immigration jails because theyhave a criminal conviction on their records or because they entered the countryseeking asylum, according to the American Civil Liberties Union. The courtorders do not call for "mass release," but only for "individualized hearings,"said Ahilan Arulanantham, an ACLU attorney from Los Angeles who will argue forthe immigrants on Wednesday.He said a significant number of the detainees are "lawful permanent residents"who had families and worked in California, yet were jailed more than a yearbefore their immigration cases were heard.The lead plaintiff, Alejandro Rodriguez, was brought to this country as aninfant and obtained lawful status, but was jailed for possible deportationbecause of a drug possession and a "joyriding" conviction as a teenager. Aftermore than three years in jail, he won his immigration case and was released.Arulanantham says immigrants like Rodriguez should be given a hearing before ajudge and released on bond if it is decided they are not a danger to thecommunity nor are likely to flee. The court order does not extend to suspectedterrorists and national security threats, he noted.But lawyers for the Obama administration urged the high court to throw out the9th Circuit's decision, which they said calls for a "dramatic and wholesalerevision" of immigration laws. They argued for a hands-off approach by judges.They said the justices should affirm "the long-standing rule that the politicalbranches have plenary [complete] control over which aliens may physically enterthe United States and under what circumstances."It's possible the eight justices could divide evenly on the new case. If so,they are likely to put off a ruling until a ninth justice is confirmed.Kevin Johnson, dean of the UC Davis Law School, said the election had put thecase in a new spotlight. "I am more concerned with immigration detention in aTrump administration," he said. "Detention will become commonplace fornoncitizens placed in removal proceedings. And with the backlog in theimmigration courts, it can take years for removal proceedings to be completed."In their legal briefs for Wednesday's case, government lawyers warned thatallowing these people to be released on bond could allow many of them to escape.It would be time-consuming and costly if agents were forced to track down peoplewho had absconded after their release, they said.The ACLU disagreed, saying the California court orders have been in effect forfour years and have not led to such problems.It says more than 95% of the people released on bond showed up for their hearingbefore an immigration judge.The high court is expected to rule early next year in the case of Jennings vs.Rodriguez.--david.savage@latimes.comTwitter: @DavidGSavage
