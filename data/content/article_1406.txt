U.K. corporate defined benefit funds saw a £35 billion ($44.1 billion)improvement in deficits in the week after the U.S. presidential election, whichis helping unwind damage done by the U.K.'s vote to leave the European Union,Hymans Robertson said.The consultant added that the data from its 3DAnalytics platform show howvolatile deficits can be. U.K. DB plan deficits now stand at £825 billion, saidthe consultant, down more than £200 billion from the all-time high of £1.03trillion in August. The deficit reduction was attributed to rising bond yields,in part due to revived inflation expectations in response to policy pledges madeby President-elect Donald J. Trump."Following a significant rally earlier this year, we've been seeing positions infixed-income assets unwind due to emerging signals from the Federal Reserve ofhigh economic growth and interest rate rises which have been amplifiedsignificantly by what the market has been calling the 'Trumpflation' trade,"said Calum Cooper, partner at Hymans Robertson, in a statement accompanying thedata. "This has seen increasing allocations to growth-focused assets that arelikely to benefit from the expected policies of the president-elect, such asspending on infrastructure, tax cuts and trade protectionist policies."Mr. Cooper said pension funds should not be knocked off course by the volatilityof deficits and should retain a long-term focus "through short-term politicalfog and uncertainty."
