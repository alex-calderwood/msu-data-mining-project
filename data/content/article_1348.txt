Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said Monday that President-elect Donald Trumpwould be making a "mistake" if his administration cuts federal funding to L.A.over the city's immigration stance."Anything that would take away federal aid would cause social, economic andsecurity problems," Garcetti said. "I am hoping we can have this conversationseparate and without threats."Reince Priebus, Trump's designee to be the White House chief of staff, told CNNon Sunday that the Trump administration is exploring cutting off federal moneyto so-called sanctuary cities.Trump vowed during the election to punish such municipalities for their lenientpolicies toward illegal immigration. Los Angeles is slated to receive about $500million this fiscal year directly from the federal government to pay forservices such as port security and homeless shelters.That figure doesn't include federal money that flows to the Los Angeles HomelessServices Authority, a joint city-county agency. The agency will receive about$23 million in federal Housing and Urban Development funds this fiscal year.L.A. police and city leaders have vocally protested any immigration crackdownunder Trump, with both Garcetti and LAPD Chief Charlie Beck saying in the lastweek that police won't change their enforcement policies.CNN's Jake Tapper asked Priebus on "State of the Union" whether Trump would cutfederal funding to Los Angeles given the city's position.Priebus said he personally feels funding shouldn't flow to sanctuary cities, butthe issue is open to negotiation."The idea that a city would decide to ignore federal law and then want thefederal government to help them anyway is an inconsistent position for thoselocal governments to continue to engage in," Priebus said.Garcetti was asked about Priebus' comments Monday at a Boyle Heights event withhigh school students centered on the issue of deportation fears under Trump."We participate all the time with our federal immigration authorities and wewill continue to do so," he said.Garcetti also suggested that programs targeting clean air and homeless fundingmay be jeopardized if federal money no longer comes in. Federal funds pay forhomeland security, too, he added."We have a mutual interest in fighting terrorism," Garcetti said.Los Angeles County is home to more than 1 million of the estimated 11 millionimmigrants in the country without legal status.Beck said last week he would not change the LAPD's stance on immigrationenforcement, despite Trump's pledge to toughen federal immigration laws anddeport millions of people upon taking office.Both Beck and Garcetti have said the LAPD will continue to enforce Special Order40, which bars officers from contacting someone solely to determine theirimmigration status.--dakota.smith@latimes.comTwitter: @dakotacdsmith
