Now that the election is over, the Democratic Party and its nominee, HillaryClinton, with clear 20-20 hindsight, realize that they completely ignored theplight of the white working class (and the middle class in general). That ourown domestic issues took a back seat to an aggressive foreign policy that wouldlikely bankrupt (if not destroy) our nation was unforgivable in the minds ofmany voters and cost the Democrats an easy victory.How is it that both the party and Ms. Clinton completely forgot (or ignored) theclarion call of Bill Clinton's campaign, "It's the economy, stupid," whichhelped him defeat George H.W. Bush in 1992? They may realize their error now,but hindsight is not a qualification for the presidency.Wayne R. Knight , McLean
