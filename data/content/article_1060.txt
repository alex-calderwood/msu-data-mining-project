At least six Democrats on the Electoral College are prepared to abandon HillaryClinton to vote for a Republican other than Donald Trump - in hopes GOP electorswill join them to keep the president-elect under the 270 votes he'll need toenter the White House.The Democrats are trying to persuade Republicans to ignore their oaths and ditchTrump, according to Politico. The electors meet on Dec. 19.The Democrats would have to persuade 37 Republican electors to defect. Thedecision would then go to the GOP-controlled House of Representatives. It'sunlikely that will happen, but the defectors could highlight the issue ofabolishing the Electoral College."Reform . . . has a better chance of succeeding than this effort," saidUniversity of Pennsylvania constitutionl law Professor Kermit Roosevelt, Teddy'dgreat-grandson.Meanwhile, Clinton's ex-campaign head, John Podesta, spoke with activists andlawyers about challenging results in three key swing states where they claim tohave found voting irregularities, according to New York magazine.
