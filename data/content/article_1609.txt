He said that threshold would constitute an internationallyrecognized threshold requiring the governor to apply to the U.N. for "theRepublic of California" to become a member of the U.N."We know that you don't just vote and that it happens. This would be to startthe conversation," he said. "You have to have something where you say this iswhat the public wants."The group tried unsuccessfully to put several initiatives on the ballot thisyear, including a proposal to declare California a separate nation, to renamethe governor the "president" of California, and to fly the California state flagatop the United States flag. Those signature-gathering efforts fizzled.Repeated attempts to create a 51st state in Northern California, named the Stateof Jefferson, have also failed. That movement generally draws more conservativesupporters who are dissatisfied with California's dominance by Democrats.Still, Ruiz said State of Jefferson supporters are welcome in the CalExitmovement, which would also shift many powers to county-level governments that hesaid are more in line with local residents' wishes.The group moved up its original plan to ask voters to approve a referendum in2020 because of the interest following Trump's election over Hillary Clinton,Ruiz said.Backers expect to begin collecting signatures after Trump's Januaryinauguration.
