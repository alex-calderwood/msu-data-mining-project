President in West Palm -elect Beach Donald , Fla Trump ., to return , his wifeto New Melania York. and son Barron, board his plane at Palm Beach InternationalAirport on SundayNEW YORK Coming off a holiday weekend in South Florida, Donald Trump unleashed aSunday morning tweet storm on Hillary Clinton over her campaign's decision tojoin a recount process on voting results in Wisconsin and perhaps other states."So much time and money will be spent - same result! Sad" Trump said in oneTwitter post.The president-elect, who spent Thanksgiving weekend at his Mar-A-Lago estate inPalm Beach, Fla., expressed his recount displeasure before his planned return toNew York City early Sunday evening.More interviews for jobs in the Trump administration are planned for the comingweek. Among the slots Trump is looking to fill: secretaries of State, Treasury,and Defense.Trump's comments about the recount capped a series of tweets in which he quotedClinton's criticism of a Trump debate comment that he might not recognize theresults on the election should he lose. At one point, Trump noted, Clintondescribed refusal to accept the results of an election as "a direct threat toour democracy."The Clinton campaign said Saturday it would participate in a Wisconsin recountsought by Green Party candidate Jill Stein, and may join Stein-backed efforts inMichigan and Pennsylvania. Officials cited voter concerns about Russian hackingand other forms of alleged voting problems.While Clinton officials said they have seen no evidence of vote tampering, anddo not expect the results in any state to change, they believe their campaignneeds to be represented during any recount process.In a post on Medium, Clinton general counsel Marc Erik Elias wrote: "Because wehad not uncovered any actionable evidence of hacking or outside attempts toalter the voting technology, we had not planned to exercise this optionourselves, but now that a recount has been initiated in Wisconsin, we intend toparticipate in order to ensure the process proceeds in a manner that is fair toall sides."Although Trump carried the states of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin by atotal of only about 107,000 votes, Elias noted that "the number of votesseparating Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton in the closest of these states -Michigan - well exceeds the largest margin ever overcome in a recount."Clinton supporters raised concerns about possible Russian hacking of theelection, though the Democratic team and the Obama administration have saidthere is no evidence of it.Trump, meanwhile, charged the Clinton campaign with hypocrisy. "Hillary Clintonconceded the election when she called me just prior to the victory speech andafter the results were in," Trump said in a post. "Nothing will change."He made some appointments and worked on other transition issues while atMar-A-Lago, including what aides said was a 45-minute phone conversationSaturday with President Obama."They've been talking regularly on any number of issues," Trump adviserKellyanne Conway said on NBC's Meet the Press.Even though Trump enjoys his chats with Obama and "they get along nicely,"Conway also said "they disagree on many things. That's not going to change."During a series of interviews, Conway said Trump also is working with aides onhow to avoid potential conflicts of interests between his actions as presidentand the many global business interests he and his family have."He has been talking to his lawyers, he's been talking to ethics compliancefolks," Conway told Meet the Press. "Everything will be done the way it needs tobe done."
