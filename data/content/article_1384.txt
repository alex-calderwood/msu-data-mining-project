The University of California announced sweeping actions Wednesday to protect itsstudents who came into the country illegally, saying it would refuse to assistfederal immigration agents, turn over confidential records without court ordersor supply information for any national registry based on race, national originor religion."While we still do not know what policies and practices the incoming federaladministration may adopt, given the many public pronouncements made during thepresidential campaign and its aftermath, we felt it necessary to reaffirm thatUC will act upon its deeply held conviction that all members of our communityhave the right to work, study, and live safely and without fear at all UClocations," UC President Janet Napolitano said in a statement.Napolitano said the university would "vigorously protect the privacy and civilrights of the undocumented members of the UC community."The policies, described as a statement of principles, mark the first unifiedapproach toward federal immigration issues for the system's 10 campuses,according to UC spokeswoman Dianne Klein.Napolitano formed a task force to examine possible actions shortly after thepresidential election of Donald Trump stirred widespread unease and uncertaintyon campuses.UC does not track students' immigration status but says about 3,700 haveobtained in-state tuition benefits under AB 540, a 2001 law designed to helpthose in the country illegally.The UC president announced the new policies a day after she and the heads of theCalifornia State University and California Community Colleges sent a jointletter to President-elect Trump urging him to allow students without legalstatus to continue their educations.Trump, during his campaign, had said he would reverse an Obama administrationprogram Napolitano created as Homeland Security secretary that deferreddeportation proceedings against certain young people who stayed in school andout of trouble. That program has helped nearly 720,000 young people nationallyand 214,000 in California apply for work permits and continue their studieswithout fear of deportation.The new policies heartened students such as Benyamin bin Mohd Yusof, who wasbrought illegally to the country from Brunei when he was 2 years old and is nowa senior at UC Berkeley.But while the UC protections will help him, he said, he worried about those notable to benefit from them."Where will that protection be for my mother and brother?" he said. "We have todo more for undocumented students and others everywhere."Among the new UC principles:* Campus police will not assist local, state or federal agents to investigate,detain or arrest students for violations of federal immigration law.* Police also will be told not to contact, detain, question or arrestindividuals solely on suspicion of immigration violations.* No confidential student records will be released without a judicial warrant,subpoena or court order unless authorized by the student or required by law.* UC will continue to admit all eligible students without regard to immigrationstatus and take the same stance in treatment of patients at its medical centers.University police should use their limited resources to build community trustand a "safe and secure environment" on campus rather than to assist inimmigration cases, which is a federal responsibility, the statement said.Campus police also will decline requests by federal immigration agents to detainany individuals unless their assistance is required by law or the individualsare wanted for serious or violent felonies. The California attorney general hasconcluded that compliance with such requests is voluntary.In addition, UC will not cooperate with any effort to compile a federal registryof selected groups of people -- such as one for Muslims, suggested by Trumpduring his campaign."A federal effort to create a registry based on any protected characteristics... would be antithetical to the United States Constitution, the CaliforniaConstitution, federal and state laws, and principles of nondiscrimination thatguide our university," the statement said.In November, Cal State affirmed that it would not help local, state or federalauthorities enforce federal immigration law.--teresa.watanabe@latimes.com
