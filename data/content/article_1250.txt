MADISON, Wis. - A Wisconsin judge refused on Tuesday to order local electionworkers to conduct the state's upcoming presidential recount completely by hand,finding that nothing suggests the state's electronic tabulating machines havebeen hacked.Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein has been trying to make the casethat Wisconsin's tabulating machines could have been compromised in acyberattack and a hand recount is the only way to tell for sure. But Dane CountyCircuit Court Judge Valerie Bailey-Rihn concluded Stein's attorneys failed toshow any hard evidence the machines were attacked and are unreliable.Donald Trump beat Hillary Clinton by about 22,000 votes in Wisconsin, but Steinhas alleged - without evidence - that the results might have been hacked. Sheasked for a recount last week, saying the state needs to be sure.State Department of Justice attorneys filed briefs Tuesday arguing that Steinhasn't shown how a hand recount would change the election's results. ElectionsCommission Administrator Mike Hass said only 19 counties plan to use electronictabulators; the rest plan to count by hand.Dane County Circuit Judge Valerie Bailey-Rihn convened a hearing late Tuesdayafternoon that went on four hours. Stein's side called computer experts whotestified that Wisconsin's electronic machines are vulnerable to cyberattack butsaid they couldn't show whether one had actually occurred."All that we have here is 100 percent hypothetical speculation about what couldpossibly happen. That's not convincing evidence," Assistant Attorney General S.Michael Murphy told the judge.Bailey-Rihn ultimately sided with the state, finding that Stein and HillaryClinton's lawyers failed to show any irregularities that prove electronictabulators could be problematic in the recount.Debbie Greenberger, one of Stein's attorneys, told reporters after the decisionthat Stein would consider appeal options. In the meantime, she said hopes thecounties take to heart the judge's remarks about a hand recount being the bestway to proceed.
