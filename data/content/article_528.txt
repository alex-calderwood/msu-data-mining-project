Former presidential candidate Mitt Romney appears to be nothing less thananother run-of-the-mill politician, who will say anything to further his ownpolitical aspirations. His prior demeaning remarks about Donald Trump werenothing less than vicious, condemning and denigrating, leaving no doubt as tohis ill feelings toward the presidential nominee. He blatantly characterizedTrump as "a fraud," "a phony," "a con man," and "a fake," "who has to bestopped," because he would "bring the country to a point of collapse!" He hadnothing good to say about this man who he said was "playing the American publicfor suckers!"Well, things have changed since Trump won the election. Romney, who is beingconsidered for a presidential cabinet position (secretary of state), has wishedthe president-elect "well," and has nothing but good things to say about the manhe said lacked character, and did not have what it takes to be president.The political flip-flopping hypocrisy is sickening!Joseph EvansMagna
