He'll eliminate the $19 trillion federal debt in eight years. He'llbalance the budget without cutting Social Security, Medicare and otherentitlements. He'll bring back lost coal jobs. He'll make Mexico pay for aborder wall. He'll deport 11 million illegal immigrants while growing theeconomy by at least 6 percent.Now Trump is the president-elect, and it's time to deliver on the impossible. Nowonder his transition is racked with chaos and infighting. Scripture tells usyou can't serve both God and mammon. Yet Trump proposes to be served by bothReince Priebus and Stephen Bannon - one a chief of staff who is a paragon of theestablishment and the other a top adviser who is a leading voice for whitesupremacists. The array of impossible promises and false claims has all theappearances of a Ponzi scheme, with the $18 trillion U.S. economy in thebalance. Bernie Madoff's scheme lost only $50 billion.Early indications are that Trump plans to continue to fake it. On Thursdaynight, he tweeted that as a result of his work with Ford, the automaker wouldkeep a plant that makes Lincoln SUVs "in Kentucky - no [sic] Mexico."But Ford had never planned to close the Kentucky plant. It was merely planningto make more Ford Escapes instead of Lincolns there - a change that would haveresulted in no job losses. Ford is proceeding with its previously announced planto build a new factory in Mexico.We see the Ponzi scheme unraveling in the substance of what Trump is proposing,too. One of Trump's surrogates, Carl Higbie, caused a furor last week by sayingthe infamous internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II provided alegal "precedent" for Trump's plan to create a Muslim registry. But for all theoutrage Higbie caused, the actual policy being floated - reinstatement of aGeorge W. Bush-era policy - is far more modest than Trump's proposed ban onMuslim immigration and threat to register American Muslims.This is the best-case scenario - that Trump's fake-news presidential campaignreally was all a con. Preposterous promises give way to modest proposals. Thiswould disappoint his supporters, but perhaps save the country.Many of Trump's absurd promises will come due soon. Trump spoke of abolishingthe Education Department and the Environmental Protection Agency, said he wouldrebuild American roads for one-third the current price, monitor mosques,prosecute Hillary Clinton and never take a vacation. He said he would "bomb thes--- out of" the Islamic State, kill the relatives of terrorists, shut downparts of the internet, reinstate waterboarding, dramatically increase tariffs,eliminate Wall Street reforms, cut the budget 20 percent and end birthrightcitizenship.No surprise that the transition is chaotic. Lobbyists are in, then out. ChrisChristie and Mike Rogers are in, then out. Frank Gaffney is in, or perhaps not.Eliot Cohen withdraws his cooperation, predicting "ugly" things ahead.And Trump says everything is proceeding "so smoothly."Trump plays cat-and-mouse with the national press corps and continues to tweetlike an internet troll, complete with bad spelling. Qualified candidates arerejected in favor of loyalists.You can't make this stuff up. Or maybe you can. Paul Horner, the leadingpurveyor of fake news on Facebook, told The Washington Post's Caitlin Dewey hewas stunned by Americans' gullibility: "I mean, that's how Trump got elected. Hejust said whatever he wanted, and people believed everything."But surely you can't fool all the people all the time.
