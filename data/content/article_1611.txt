Xavier Becerra nominated for state attorney generalBYLINE: Jonathan J. Cooper; The Associated PressSECTION: A,A; Pg. 3LENGTH: 711 wordsABSTRACTGov. Jerry Brown has tapped U.S. Rep. Xavier Becerra to succeed Kamala Harris asCalifornia attorney generalFULL TEXTSACRAMENTO >> California Gov. Jerry Brown on Thursday named U.S. Rep. XavierBecerra as state attorney general, succeeding newly elected U.S. Sen. KamalaHarris and ending speculation about whether he would appoint a caretaker or anambitious Democrat for the second-highest statewide office.Becerra, 58, a rising star in the party who served as a high-profile Latinosurrogate for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton's campaign thisyear. He was widely discussed as a potential cabinet appointee if Clinton won.But with the election of Trump and a Republican sweep of both houses ofCongress, his 24-year tenure in the House is no longer as appealing. In theattorney general's position, Becerra could serve through 2018 then seek anothereight years after that.Trump's election upended his path to influence, said Thad Kousser, PoliticalScience Department chair at the University of California, San Diego."Washington, DC is now red territory, so if he wants to have an impact onpolicy, California's the place to do it," Kousser said.The Democratic governor noted Becerra's service in Congress, in the stateLegislature and as a deputy attorney general. The nomination is subject toconfirmation by the state Assembly and Senate. It will be officially submittedafter Harris resigns."I'm confident he will be a champion for all Californians and help our stateaggressively combat climate change," the Democratic governor said in astatement.If confirmed, Becerra will be the state's chief law enforcement officer and willoversee the legal defenses of California's aggressive efforts to controlgreenhouse gases. He'll also preside over likely skirmishes between the state'sliberal lawmakers and the administration of Republican President-elect DonaldTrump.Becerra said in a statement that Brown had presented him with an opportunity hecan't refuse."As a former deputy attorney general, I relished the chance to be our state'schief law enforcement officer to protect consumers, advance criminal justicereform and, of course, keep our families safe," Becerra said. He noted that hetraveled to 15 states as he campaigned for congressional candidates inbattleground districts this year."But California right now is ahead of the country when it comes to clean energy,commonsense treatment of immigrants, real health security and so much more," hesaid.As Democratic caucus chairman, Becerra is the highest ranking Latino inCongress, where he has served since 1992. Brown's announcement noted that he wasthe first in his family to graduate from college, obtaining both bachelor ofarts and law degrees from Stanford University.Kousser noted that going to battle in the courtroom with the Trumpadministration over climate change and immigration will raise his profile bothin California and nationally, which would help him if he wants to run forgovernor in 2018 or to replace Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., when she decidesto retire.It also gives him a leg up against other rising Latino officials with ambitionfor higher office, including state Senate President Pro Tem Kevin de Leon, D-LosAngeles, and former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa.Becerra's replacement in his solidly Democratic district in Los Angeles would bepicked via special election. His expected departure immediately set offspeculation about his potential replacement. Former Assembly Speaker John Perezquickly announced he would seek the seat representing areas including downtown,Boyle Heights, Chinatown and Highland Park.Becerra is likely to face easy confirmation in the Democratically controlledLegislature. De Leon and Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon, D-Paramount, bothreleased effusive statements praising Becerra as someone who will stand up toWashington and defend the rights of Californians.Michael Rushford, president of the conservative Criminal Justice LegalFoundation, doesn't expect major changes in criminal justice policy with Becerraatop the state Department of Justice."The governor has done a lot of things with regards to criminal justice policythat I suspect he wants to have kept in place," Rushford said.
