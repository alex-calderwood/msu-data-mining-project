LIMA, Peru - Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg urged world leaders meeting in Peru onSaturday to help get more people online as a way to improve global livingstandards while separately announcing new measures to cut down on fake newsstories on the social network that some suggest could have helped sway the U.S.presidential election.The Facebook founder took on the role of an evangelist for "connectivity" as hespoke at an Asian-Pacific trade summit, lamenting that half the world has noaccess to the online world and is being deprived of its economic potential aswell as advances in science, education and medicine. He urged leaders to workwith his company and others to close that gap."If we can connect the 4 billion people who aren't connected, we can lifthundreds of millions of people out of poverty," Zuckerberg said as he addressedbusiness and government leaders at the 21-nation Asia-Pacific EconomicCooperation Forum.But as he was promoting the benefits of the online world in the speech, he tookto his Facebook page to address one of the downsides of the internet: the rapiddissemination of bogus news stories on social networks.Zuckerberg said in a post that his company was taking measures to curb what hesaid was a "relatively small" percentage of deliberately false stories. Themeasures include developing new tools to detect and classify "misinformation"and to make it easier for users to report the material.He said the company also is looking into the possibility of working withestablished fact-checking organizations to evaluate content and into thefeasibility of warning labels for stories flagged as false.Critics have complained that a surge of fake news stories on Facebook may haveswayed some voters to back President-elect Donald Trump. The company said onMonday that it was clarifying its advertising policy to emphasize that it won'tdisplay ads - thus cutting revenue - for sites that run information that is"illegal, misleading or deceptive, which includes fake news."That followed a similar step by Google."The bottom line is: we take misinformation seriously," the Facebook CEO said inhis post.
