RALEIGH, N.C. - Republican incumbent Pat McCrory and his Democratic opponent inthe undecided North Carolina governor's race have together sent or receivedhundreds of messages from private email accounts -a sidestep around officialcommunication channels that McCrory's team blasted as "questionable" in acomparison to Hillary Clinton.McCrory and Attorney General Roy Cooper - locked in a hotly contested race, withCooper leading by just over 10,000 votes of more than 4.7 million cast and astate recount possible - each conducted state business via their private emails,The Associated Press learned from documents provided under North Carolina'spublic records law.Staffers for both candidates have lagged in producing the emails as required bystate law and won't say when they will fully comply with AP requests made monthsago. The AP sought from both men personal emails they sent or received acrossstate servers between Election Day four years ago and the end of last year.That delay comes despite an updated email management system installed in 2014that allows the retrieval of almost any email sent through state governmentservers within minutes, said Tracy Doaks, the state's deputy chief informationofficer.In response to the AP requests, aides for McCrory and Cooper said they culledthe private messages for information that the law allows to be withheld orrequires kept secret. It's impossible to know how much communication they havewithheld."Our office does not release records without a thorough review for personnelinformation, attorney-client privileged information, criminal recordinformation, and/or personal financial information," Cooper spokeswoman NoelleTalley wrote in an email.McCrory's staff stopped in September providing the private email records soughtby the AP and wouldn't respond when asked about their progress. Talley said inOctober that she couldn't estimate how many more of Cooper's personal emailsinvolving state business were yet to be produced.Cooper had sent only a handful of emails using his official state account in the16 years he has been the state's top prosecutor. Talley said Cooper preferredcommunicating in person or by phone but wouldn't respond when asked whether theDemocrat minimized his use of official email in preference to his privateaccount.Clinton, the Democratic presidential candidate, was attacked by Republicansthroughout the campaign for maintaining a private email server during her timeas secretary of state and for refusing to release some personal emails. TheState Department's inspector general found that Clinton broke department ruleswhen she used private email for government business, concluding that she createda security risk and violated transparency and disclosure policies. Clinton saidshe did nothing wrong.Public officials who communicate through private emails may be trying tocircumvent public records laws or just seeking greater convenience, saidJonathan Jones, director of the North Carolina Open Government Coalition at ElonUniversity. Either way, as Clinton's email controversy showed, it fostersmistrust if private email leaves the account holder in control of what ispublicly released, Jones said."I think to a lot of citizens, that's why it matters," Jones said. "They'rebothered by an air of secrecy."The practice of skirting official email accounts and communicating privately hasbeen employed by politicians of both major parties, including former RepublicanGov. Mitt Romney of Massachusetts and Chicago's Democratic mayor, Rahm Emanuel.
