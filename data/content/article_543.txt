Declarations rebuke hate speech and promote inclusivenessThe cities of Ridgefield and Vancouver, as well as the Clark County council,have joined the growing number of local governments across the country issuingproclamations decrying hate speech and reaffirming their inclusive values.Following the divisive and racially charged presidential election, localgovernments, ranging from major cities to school boards, have made formalgestures to condemn violence and harassment against minority communities whilecalling for unity. The Southern Poverty Law Center, a Montgomery, Ala.-basednational monitor of hate groups, has reported an uptick in incidents ofharassment and intimidation against racial and religious minorities with 701incidents since Election Day on Nov. 8.Locally, Bridgette Fahnbulleh, president-elect of the Vancouver chapter of theNAACP, said her organization has received increased reports of harassment sincethe election, and she was "cautiously optimistic" about the recentproclamations from Clark County and the city of Vancouver.She said her organization has received reports of harassment from individualsin Vancouver. She said most reports have come from Vancouver schools and haveincluded Latino students' being told by their peers to go back to Mexico orthat they would be deported soon, a reference to President-elect Donald Trump'shard-line immigration policies."The atmosphere has changed," Fahnbulleh said.At Vancouver City Council's Monday meeting, Mayor Tim Leavitt read aproclamation on behalf of the city declaring that "we are a nation bound not byrace or religion, but by the shared values of freedom, liberty and equality.Our community is strengthened by our growing diversity and ensuring thatpathways that foster diversity, dignity, tolerance and respect remain clear andopen."The proclamation also encouraged leaders in the federal government to "quicklydevelop a humane and efficient pathway to immigrant legalization, including aprocess that does not mandate the deportation of otherwise law-abidingresidents of our community."During the election, Republican presidential nominee Trump repeatedly calledfor the deportation of undocumented immigrants and for a wall to be built alongthe country's southern border to prevent illegal immigration."There are a lot of people in our community that understandably have anxietyand fear about their safety, their security and their livelihoods here in theU.S.," Leavitt said. "And there are a lot of people who are anxious because ofthe rhetoric we heard during the election."Leavitt said that he's heard of incidents involving inflammatory graffiti orracially charged remarks being made to people in Vancouver. But neither he northe Vancouver Police Department have heard of any major recent events involvingracial hostility, he said."The reality is in every community there is an element of racism andignorance," he said.He said he wanted to set a positive tone for the city with the proclamation andalso to call attention to what he said is broad support for an overhaul of U.S.immigration policy.Ridgefield Mayor Ron Onslow issued a proclamation that was supportedunanimously by its city council on Nov. 17.Unlike the proclamation issued by Leavitt, Onslow's did not contain anylanguage directed at federal immigration policy. The proclamation states inpart that "reports of bullying, harassment, hate speech and violence have risenacross the nation in past months."The proclamation declares that Ridgefield supports the efforts of Not in OurTown, a national campaign to stop hate speech and promote inclusiveness. Itfurther states that "when people stand together for what is right, they buildstrong, diverse communities that are safe for everyone."Onslow said that the proclamation wasn't issued in response to any incident inRidgefield."We just want to stay ahead of things because we are growing so fast and wehave a very diverse community," Onslow said.On Tuesday, the Clark County council issued a similarly worded proclamationwithout any discussion. After the meeting, Council Chair Marc Boldt told TheColumbian that he began considering the proclamation, which was signed by everymember of the council, after riots broke out in Portland in response to Trump'selection victory.As for other municipalities in Clark County, Battle Ground Mayor Philip Johnsonsaid his city may consider a similar proclamation after Thanksgiving. WashougalMayor Sean Guard didn't respond to a request for comment. Camas Mayor ScottHiggins said there were no current plans to issue a proclamation, in partbecause he said his city already is an inclusive place."We've been proclaiming that for years," he said.Jake Thomas: 360-735-4515;jake.thomas@columbian.com; twitter.com/jakethomas2009
