Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign has been quietly exploring whether therewas any "outside interference" in the election results and will participate inthe election recount in Wisconsin initiated by Green Party presidentialcandidate Jill Stein, a Clinton campaign lawyer revealed Saturday.In a Medium post, Clinton campaign lawyer Marc Elias wrote that the campaign hadreceived "hundreds of messages, emails, and calls urging us to do something,anything, to investigate claims that the election results were hacked andaltered in a way to disadvantage Secretary Clinton," especially in Michigan,Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, where the "combined margin of victory for DonaldTrump was merely 107,000 votes."Elias wrote that the campaign had "not uncovered any actionable evidence ofhacking or outside attempts to alter the voting technology." But because of themargin of victory -- and because of the degree of apparent foreign interferenceduring the campaign -- Elias wrote that Clinton officials had "quietly taken anumber of steps in the last two weeks to rule in or out any possibility ofoutside interference in the vote tally in these critical battleground states."He wrote they would also participate in the Stein-initiated recount inWisconsin, and if Stein made good on efforts to prompt similar processes inPennsylvania and Michigan, they would do so there, as well."The campaign is grateful to all those who have expended time and effort toinvestigate various claims of abnormalities and irregularities," Elias wrote."While that effort has not, in our view, resulted in evidence of manipulation ofresults, now that a recount is underway, we believe we have an obligation to themore than 64 million Americans who cast ballots for Hillary Clinton toparticipate in ongoing proceedings to ensure that an accurate vote count will bereported."The presidential campaign was marked by fears that Russian hacking might affectthe outcome, especially after Russian hackers penetrated the computer network ofthe Democratic National Committee and were found to have attempted intrusions onvoter registration databases. The Washington Post also recently reported, citingresearchers who tracked the phenomenon, that Russians created and spread fakenews about the election with the apparent goal of helping Donald Trump.During the campaign, Clinton criticized Trump for refusing to say that he wouldaccept the election results if Clinton won. Asked during an October debatewhether he would do so, Trump responded that he would "keep you in suspense."Clinton called that answer "horrifying" and said Trump was "talking down ourdemocracy.""Donald Trump refused to say that he'd respect the results of this election,"her campaign later posted on Twitter. "By doing that, he's threatening ourdemocracy."In recent days, though, it is Clinton's supporters who have raised questionsabout the outcome of the election. A viral post spread by some Clinton backers,including actress Debra Messing, suggested -- falsely -- that the JusticeDepartment was "tallying calls" from people who wanted an audit of the 2016election and urged people to make their displeasure known."Even if it's busy, keep calling," said one version. "We should not back downfrom this."New York Magazine then reported that Clinton was being urged "by a group ofprominent computer scientists and election lawyers" to call for a recount inWisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, and the group had some evidence ofpossibly unusual activity. That fueled even more skepticism and calls for actionby Clinton supporters.The evidence of possible malfeasance, though, was limited. According to themagazine, the group found that Clinton "received 7 percent fewer votes incounties that relied on electronic-voting machines compared with counties thatused optical scanners and paper ballots," and "Based on this statisticalanalysis, Clinton may have been denied as many as 30,000 votes; she lostWisconsin by 27,000."J. Alex Halderman, one of the academics reportedly involved, later wrote onMedium that the deviations were "probably not" the result of a cyberattack, butthat "the only way to know whether a cyberattack changed the result is toclosely examine the available physical evidence.-- paper ballots and voting equipment in critical states like Wisconsin,Michigan, and Pennsylvania."Posting a link to a New York Times story about Clinton supporters calling for arecount, senior Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway said, "Look who 'can't accept theelection results.'"Elias' post might fuel similar criticism. Notably, though, Clinton did notinitiate the recount herself, and Elias wrote that the campaign had not plannedto, because it had found no actionable evidence of hacking.The Clinton campaign had investigated the matter extensively. Elias wrote thecampaign had "lawyers and data scientists and analysts combing over the resultsto spot anomalies" and had also "monitored and staffed the postelectioncanvasses -- where voting machine tapes are compared to poll-books, provisionalballots are resolved, and all of the math is double checked from ElectionNight." He wrote that the campaign had also met with outside experts and"attempted to systematically catalog and investigate every theory that has beenpresented to us within our ability to do so."Now that a recount effort was underway, Elias wrote that it was "important" toparticipate in the proceedings. He played down the idea that the recount wouldchange the outcome."We do so fully aware that the number of votes separating Donald Trump andHillary Clinton in the closest of these states -- Michigan -- well exceeds thelargest margin ever overcome in a recount," Elias wrote. "But regardless of thepotential to change the outcome in any of the states, we feel it is important,on principle, to ensure our campaign is legally represented in any courtproceedings and represented on the ground in order to monitor the recountprocess itself."Brian Fallon, a spokesman for the Clinton campaign, rejected the notion that thecampaign's actions might suggest to some that it was not accepting the electionresults."The post says we would not have sought the recount on our own, that we see noevidence of tampering so far, and acknowledge the margin in Michigan, which isthe tightest of the three, exceeds the largest deficit ever overcome in arecount," Fallon wrote to The Washington Post. "We note we are guarding ourprerogatives now that someone else has launched a recount. Not sure what youcould point to to suggest there is anything here that calls the results intoquestion."A Trump spokeswoman did not immediately return a message seeking comment.LOAD-DATE: November 28, 2016LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: Newspaper
