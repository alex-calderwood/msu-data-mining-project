LONDON - The man who will soon occupy the Oval Office calls himself Mr. Brexit.He was perhaps the biggest foreign cheerleader for Britain's departure from theEuropean Union before the country voted, and he celebrated on Scottish soil whenit opted to get out.He says he wants to do a trade deal with Britain, and he invited a Britishpolitician to be his first international visitor upon winning the White House.In many ways, Donald Trump's victory in the U.S. presidential election wouldseem to be a boon for Britain as it prepares to file its divorce papers with theE.U.Boris Johnson, Britain's voluble foreign secretary, said as much, calling it "amoment of opportunity."But rather than grease Britain's exit path, Trump's elevation to the peak ofU.S. power could make this country's already tortuous road to Brexit evenrougher.Reactions such as Johnson's, said Queen Mary University of London politicsprofessor Tim Bale, are merely "a front" that masks a deep anxiety among Britishofficials over whether Trump can be trusted."I think there's an awful lot of nervousness in government and more generally,mostly down to the unpredictability of the guy," Bale said.That worry is being felt worldwide.But in London, it is especially acute.Since World War II, Britain has positioned itself as the bridge linking theUnited States to Europe, with sturdy ties on either side. But now both ends ofthat connection are looking creaky.Britain's June 23 decision to exit the E.U. has set the stage for years ofcomplex - and potentially acrimonious - breakup negotiations in which most ofthe leverage lies with Europe. The continent's leaders have taken a hard line inthe months since the vote, insisting that Britain will not get the sweetheartdeal it has sought.Brexit advocates have played down any concerns over strained relations withEurope, insisting that Britain outside the E.U. has the chance to reassertitself in the wider world - particularly in the Anglosphere with countries suchas Canada, Australia and, most important, the United States.President Obama delivered a blow to that theory in the spring when he urgedBritons to vote against an exit and said the country would need to go "to theback of the queue" in negotiating a free-trade deal with the United States.Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton took a similar tack.Trump has adopted a very different approach, insisting that Britain will beprioritized. Johnson noted Monday that Trump is "a dealmaker, and I think thatcould be a good thing for Britain."But Britain may not like the deal that Trump has to offer.The billionaire real estate developer railed against trade deals during thepresidential campaign, insisting that the exchanges are zero-sum and alwaysfavor the other side at the expense of the United States. "We have to stop thesecountries from stealing our companies and our jobs," he said repeatedly.Trump has pledged to reverse that dynamic as president and to reduce the U.S.trade deficit. Britain now has a trade surplus with the United States, making itvulnerable to protectionist efforts by Trump to limit British imports atprecisely the moment when Britain needs to start selling more to the worldbeyond Europe.Eric Kaufman, professor of politics at Birkbeck College, said there is likely tobe "an affinity" between Trump and British Prime Minister Theresa May becauseboth leaders' countries have experienced populist revolts against the globalorder.But while May on Monday said she wants Britain to be "the true global championof free trade in this new modern world," Trump's threats to tear up existingtrade agreements probably would complicate that task."The worry would be if the rules-based international trading order is weakenedby Trump, that's not great for Britain trying to champion a free trading orderoutside of the E.U.," Kaufman said.There is also the question of timing: Even if Trump wants to do a quick tradedeal with Britain, the latter is not well-positioned because the negotiations tocome with the E.U. are already more than it can bear.A recent memo by a government contractor assessing Britain's progress indeveloping its Brexit strategy concluded that the government still lacks anoverall plan five months after the vote and that it may need another six monthsto devise one.Indeed, Britain's response to Trump - which has been notably warmer than that ofother European powers - may be less about any realistic hopes of a deal and moreabout attempting to gain leverage with Europe.The response, Bale said, is "consistent with a game we have played for decadeswhere the U.K. suggests to the Europeans we have a unique insight into theAmerican mind, and we suggest to the Americans we are a useful bridge toEurope."In at least one sense, that may continue to be true in the Trump era. Trump,whose mother was Scottish and who owns Scottish golf courses, appears to have agenuine affection for Britain."The traditional white Anglo world," said London School of Economics professorTony Travers, is one that Trump and his backers "see as broadly their kind ofworld."And at least with certain British politicians, the affinity is apparent.Longtime Brexit champion Nigel Farage campaigned for Trump in the United Statesand was the first foreign politician invited to meet with the president-elect atTrump Tower.Britain's actual leader, May, has not received as favorable a reception.According to a Times of London account of their 10-minute call, he was notexactly insistent in his invitation for her to follow Farage up the elevator tohis Trump Tower suite."If you travel to the U.S.," he reportedly said, "you should let me know."griff.witte@washpost.comkarla.adam@washpost.com
