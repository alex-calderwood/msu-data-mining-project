WASHINGTON -- Donald Trump, that most unconventional of presidential candidates,last spring pledged that he would act perfectly presidential when the time wasright."I will be so presidential that you'll call me and you'll say, 'Donald, you haveto stop that, it's too much,'" he promised during a March television interview.Less than two months from Inauguration Day, there are growing signs that Trump'sidea of what's presidential may never sync up with past norms -- to the delightof some and dismay of others.The president-elect has kept up his habit of sending unfiltered tweets, directlychallenged the First Amendment right to burn the flag and selected aflame-throwing outsider for a top adviser.He's shown no hesitation to traffic in unsubstantiated rumors, has mixeddealings in business and government, and has flouted diplomatic conventions tomake his own suggestion for who should be Britain's ambassador to the U.S., ajob that happens to already be filled.He's picked numerous fights with individual journalists, disregarded pastpractices on press access and dabbled in the name-calling that was commonplaceduring his candidacy.Trump's search for Cabinet nominees has played out like a reality TV show, witha number of candidates engaged in unabashed self-promotion while their assetsand liabilities are publicly debated by members of the president-elect's owntransition team. (It's normally a hush-hush process until the unveiling of anappointee). Trump's tweet that "Fidel Castro is dead!" had none of thediplomatic subtleties normally associated with such an internationaldevelopment. Is this the "new normal" for what to expect from a Trumpadministration or a reflection of the growing pains associated with anypresidential transition?President Barack Obama, has expressed hope that the weight of the office willultimately have a sobering effect on Trump, cautioning people against assuming"the worst."Republican Rep. Mark Meadows of North Carolina, a strong conservative and aTrump defender, said of the transition, "You gotta break a few eggs to make anomelet."But Thomas Mann, a longtime scholar of government from the BrookingsInstitution, said that while people can hope for the best, "There's no reason totake what's going on with anything other than great uneasiness and caution aboutthe kind of government that is preparing to take control in the United States.""To call this the 'new normal' is to make light of the seriousness of what'sgoing on," Mann said.Trump has "got to get some discipline," said New York University's Paul Light,another scholar of government. "He's just got to get on this."
