For some Jews who support Donald  Trump and are feeling under attack after theappointment of Stephen Bannon to a top White  House position, a new line ofdefense has emerged:  The Democrats are just as bad.The comparison is with Minnesota Rep. Keith  Ellison, the leading candidate forchairman of the  Democratic National Committee, and the argument   goessomething like this: Ellison, a Muslim  who is critical of Israel, is just asbad as Bannon, the  former publisher of the Breitbart News Network  website.Bannon made the site into a platform  for the 'alt-right,' which is the labelpreferred by  contemporary white supremacists and nationalists  who traffic inracist stereotypes.They're accusing Bannon of being racist and anti-Semitic  and yet they fail tolook at the very clear  connections of Keith Ellison to radical Islamistgroups, to anti-Semitism, said Brooke Goldstein,  executive director and CEO ofThe Lawfare Project,  in a November 17 Fox News interview. I mean, it'sboggling.The Yeshiva World website called Ellison The  Real Number 1 Anti-Semite in theU.S.Ellison, 53, is the first Muslim American elected   to Congress. With thebacking of his political  mentor, Sen. Bernie Sanders, and the endorsement  ofthe incoming Senate Minority Leader, Chuck  Schumer, Ellison is, at the moment,favored to win  over the party chairmanship, a position vacant  since Rep.Debbie Wasserman Schultz was forced  out on the eve of the Democratic conventionthis  past summer.The litany of claims hurled at Ellison by Jewish  activists, almost all from theright, ranges from his  past support for Louis Farrakhan (since renounced);  hiscriticism of Israel's actions in the West Bank  and Gaza, and past associationswith Muslim  groups in America.Others in the Jewish community are unequivocalin rebutting the anti-Semitism charge,  even while opposing his Middle Eastviews. Jonathan Greenblatt, the head  of the Anti-Defamation League, for  one,told The New York Times that,  to the contrary, Ellison was an  important allyin the fight against  anti-Semitism, though he has taken  positions on theIsraeli-Palestinian  conflict on which we strongly differ  and that concern us.Jewish activists who have dealt with  him, meanwhile, both in his home  stateand on the national level, speak  of an elected official who is committed  tointerfaith dialogue and who cares  deeply about Middle East peace.Ellison, who was first elected to  Congress in 2006, grew up in Detroit  andconverted to Islam while in  college. His background in civil rights  activismand his progressive positions  in Congress made him one of Sanders's   mostvocal supporters during the  recent Democratic presidential primary.   Sandersin turn appointed Ellison  to the Democratic Party's platform  committee lastsummer. In Minnesota,   he forged close ties with the local  Jewish communitywhen he decided  to enter politics.Now that Ellison's in the spotlight,  the Jewish community is looking at  twocompeting images of him. One:  an extremist critic of Israel who will  drag theDemocratic Party away from  its support for the Jewish state. The  other: aleader who is dedicated to  promoting peace and a two-state solution   of itsyears-long conflict with the  Palestinians.As for the facts: In the 1990s, Ellison  did support the Nation of Islam andits leader, Farrakhan, who has been  widely denounced for his anti-Semiticcomments throughout the years.  Before running for Congress, Ellison   turned tothe Minnesota Jewish  Community Relations Council and  denounced Farrakhan'sviews on  Jews.I wrongly dismissed concerns that  they were anti-Semitic, Ellison wrote.  Theywere and are anti-Semitic and I  should have come to that conclusion  earlierthan I did.But most of Ellison's detractors  have criticized him for his views on  theIsraeli-Palestinian conflict. In  Congress, Ellison took special interest   inthe plight of Palestinians under  Israeli occupation, especially after  the 2008Israeli military operation  in Gaza. A tweet of Ellison's, posted  earlier thisyear after visiting Hebron,  brought further allegations of anti-Semitismagainst him. It showed a  window of a Palestinian home, stating   that theproperty was taken by  Israeli apartheid.The Zionist Organization of America   lashed out at Ellison, stating that  if hebecomes DNC chair, Ellison  will likely be empowered to persuade  even moreDemocratic congresspersons   to join him in actions hostile to  Israel'ssecurity and Israeli civilians'  lives  wreaking enormous damage  to theprospects for future bipartisan  support for America's closest ally in  theMiddle East.But his supporters in the Jewish  community see a different picture  altogether.They note Ellison's commitment to  bringing peace to the Middle East.  What doyou expect? He's a Muslim  and he's going to identify with the  Palestiniancause, but he has demonstrated   time and again his support  for Israel, saidRabbi Marc Schneier,   founder and president of the  Foundation for EthnicUnderstanding.   Schneier, who is the co-author  of the 2013 book Sons ofAbraham:  A Candid Conversation About Issues  That Divide and Unite Jews andMuslims, recalled how Ellison, in  2007, spoke out against Iran'sHolocaust-denying conference and later,  in 2013, initiated a letter to Hamasleaders, urging the release of the  captive Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit.  Todemonize him as an anti-Semite  is just an outrage, Schneier told the  Forward,adding that comparing Ellison   to Bannon is unfair.The Religious Action Center of  Reform Judaism also spoke out in  favor ofEllison, noting his work with  the Jewish community on issues ranging   fromconfronting the Darfur  genocide to protecting religious freedoms.   On Israel,said RAC's director,  Rabbi Jonah Pesner, the group has not  always agreed withEllison, including  when he refused to support funding  for the anti-rocket IronDome system  in Congress, but there has been  plenty of common ground where ourwork together has made a difference.Another claim leveled at Ellison  had to do with his association with  AmericanIslamic groups, especially   the Council on American-Islamic  Relations, a groupthat many Jewish  groups refuse to engage with because  of its views on theIsraeli-Palestinian  conflict and a past claim of connections   to a fundraisingoperation of  Hamas in America.Much of the backlash against Ellison   is directed now at Schumer, the  New Yorksenator who is considered  a strong defender of Israel and a close  ally to theorganized Jewish community.Does Senator Schumer actually   believe that there is literally not a  singleother person in the Democratic  Party, anywhere in the country, who  would be abetter choice than Ellison?   New York Assemblyman Dov  Hikind asked in aninterview in the  newswire JNS. Why is Schumer in  such a rush to support acandidate  who is so unfriendly to Israel?Schumer's office, in response,  argued that Ellison's selection to  chair theparty will not change the  Democrats' commitment to Israel:  Democrats have anexcellent platform,   including one of the strongest  pro-Israel platforms.Keith Ellison was  instrumental in making that happen  and persuading others tosupport it.
