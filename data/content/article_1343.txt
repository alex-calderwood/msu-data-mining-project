With Democrats still reeling from the presidential election, House Democraticleader Nancy Pelosi has agreed to a request to move the Democratic Caucus'leadership election until after Thanksgiving.Pelosi, a Californian who has led House Democrats for more than 16 years,including two terms as the first female House speaker, is facing a possiblechallenge from Rep. Tim Ryan of Ohio, who told Politico he is considering a bid.Democrats won only six new seats Nov. 8, after months of predictions that rangedfrom a large Democratic win to a significant narrowing of the Republicans'majority in the House.Coupled with losing the presidency because some traditionally blue Rust Beltstates turned red, some on Capitol Hill are saying privately that it's time fornew leadership that hails from the center of the country.The leadership election date has been moved back and forth a few times. At onepoint, uncontested races were scheduled for Nov. 17, while the contested races-- such as the Democratic Caucus vice chairman race between two Californiamembers -- would have been held after Thanksgiving break.With Pelosi's announcement last week, all of the Democrats' leadership electionswill be held Nov. 30.In their first meeting since the election, Pelosi told fellow Democrats that shedoesn't have a preference for when the election is held, but that the caucusneeds to present a united front to Republicans, and soon."I do believe that time is important on this subject -- for us to go to thetable fully empowered to do what we need to do. From my standpoint, I don't carewhen the election is. I do care that we have the strongest possible leadershipat the table, whoever that may be," she said, according to an aide in the room.House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Bakersfield), took a dig last week atPelosi's potential contested election, saying that as long as she is leader,Republicans will stay in power.--sarah.wire@latimes.com
