HIGHLIGHT: Steven Mnuchin, the financier who has been tapped to run Treasury,joins other wealthy investors chosen by Mr. Trump, a sign of possible tax cutsand deregulation ahead.In a campaign commercial that ran just before the election, Donald J. Trump'svoice boomed over a series of Wall Street images. He described "a global powerstructure that is responsible for the economic decisions that have robbed ourworking class, stripped our country of its wealth, and put that money into thepockets of a handful of large corporations."The New York Stock Exchange, the hedge fund billionaire George Soros and thechief executive of the investment bank Goldman Sachs flashed across the screen.Now Mr. Trump has named a former Goldman executive and co-investor with Mr.Soros to spearhead his economic policy.With Wednesday's nomination of Steven Mnuchin, a Goldman trader turned hedgefund manager and Hollywood financier, to be Treasury secretary, a new economicleadership is taking shape in Washington.Mr. Mnuchin will join Wilbur L. Ross Jr., a billionaire investor in distressedassets, who has been chosen to run the Commerce Department, and Todd Ricketts,owner of the Chicago Cubs, who has been picked to be deputy commerce secretary.All are superwealthy and to be overseen by the first billionaire president inUnited States history.That two investors - Mr. Mnuchin and Mr. Ross - will occupy two major economicpositions in the new administration is the most powerful signal yet that Mr.Trump plans to emphasize policies friendly to Wall Street, like tax cuts and arelaxation of regulation, in the early days of his administration.While that approach has been cheered by investors (the stocks of Bank ofAmerica, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have been on a tear since theelection), it stands in stark contrast to the populist campaign that Mr. Trumpran and the support he received from working-class voters across the country.Anthony Scaramucci, a hedge fund executive and member of the Trump transitionteam, insisted on Wednesday that appointing wealthy investors did not contradictthe campaign's populist message."The working-class people of the United States, they need a break," Mr.Scaramucci said. "And we need to switch them from going from the working classinto the working poor into what I call the aspirational working class, which mydad was a member of."Still, Democrats were quick to attack the latest nomination."Steve Mnuchin is just another Wall Street insider," Senator Bernie Sanders ofVermont and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said in a joint statement."That is not the type of change that Donald Trump promised to bring toWashington - that is hypocrisy at its worst."So far, none of the nominees who will be shaping economic policy have anysignificant experience in government.Mr. Mnuchin, 53, and Mr. Ross, 79, are both familiar with buying distressedproperties and selling for a profit. But they are political neophytes with scantexperience in managing large organizations. They will oversee two governmentagencies that together employ about 130,000 people around the world.In the case of Mr. Mnuchin at Treasury, his experience as a principal investorwho made large sums of money through high-risk, high-return wagers suggests thathe will look critically at the thicket of regulations that now constrain therisk-taking activities of investment banks.That could mean a reassessment of what has come to be known as the Volcker Rule,part of the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul that followed the 2008 financialcrisis. The rule forbids banks to make certain speculative investments withtheir own capital."I would say the No. 1 problem with the Volcker Rule is it's too complicated andpeople don't know how to interpret it," Mr. Mnuchin said in an interview withCNBC on Wednesday. "So we're going to look at what to do with it as we are withall of Dodd-Frank. The No. 1 priority is going to be to make sure that bankslend."In the interview, Mr. Mnuchin also said he would look to cutting corporate taxrates as a way to increase economic growth. And he said the wealthy would notsee a big tax cut."Any reductions we have in upper-income taxes will be offset by less deductionsso that there will be no absolute tax cut for the upper class," Mr. Mnuchin saidin the interview. "There will be a big tax cut for the middle class, but any taxcuts we have for the upper class will be offset by less deductions that pay forit."There is a Washington tradition of presidents calling on a Goldman Sachsluminary to take the reins of the economy, including the Democrat Robert E.Rubin in 1995 and Henry M. Paulson Jr., a Republican, in 2006.Mr. Mnuchin's Goldman pedigree is as good as it gets, given that his father,Robert, was a pioneer in stock trading who spent 35 years at the firm.While the Goldman brand may have initially attracted Mr. Trump, for the broaderfinancial community it is Mr. Mnuchin's track record at hedge and private equityfunds, which is where the real money is made on Wall Street these days, thatmakes him appealing."Mnuchin as Treasury secretary is somebody who can speak to bankers - JamieDimon, Lloyd Blankfein, James Gorman and Brian Moynihan. He can speak theirlanguage," said Gary Kaminsky, a former vice chairman at Morgan Stanley,referring to the chief executives of JPMorgan Chase, Goldman, Morgan Stanley andBank of America. "He comes from a trading desk, and that's something that isvery strong," Mr. Kaminsky, who has attended fund-raisers for Mr. Trump, added.While there is little doubt that Mr. Mnuchin can speak the language of WallStreet, he has had little experience running large, complex bureaucracies. Mr.Rubin and Mr. Paulson had ascended to the top at Goldman, and had many years ofexperience managing people and organizations under their belt.Mr. Mnuchin did assume a leading role in the restructuring and reinventing ofIndyMac, now known as OneWest, a California mortgage giant that collapsed in2008. He and partners acquired the firm and later made billions.After he moved from New York to the West Coast, Mr. Mnuchin was targeted byprotesters who claimed that the bank was too quick to foreclose on strugglinghomeowners. Last year the bank was sold to the CIT Group, a small-businesslender run at the time by another Goldman Sachs alumnus, John A. Thain.In a statement announcing his economic appointments, Mr. Trump highlighted thedeal. "He purchased IndyMac Bank for $1.6 billion and ran it veryprofessionally, selling it for $3.4 billion plus a return of capital," he saidof Mr. Mnuchin. "That's the kind of people I want in my administrationrepresenting our country."Mr. Mnuchin has faced other controversies. In 2010, he and his brother, Alan,were sued over their mother's early investment with Bernard L. Madoff, aninvestor who was convicted of running a Ponzi scheme. The lawsuit, filed by atrustee for Madoff victims, alleged that $3.2 million of the money Mr. Mnuchinwithdrew from his mother's account shortly after she died belonged to othervictims. The lawsuit was dropped last year because of a time limit.Hollywood has been another reinvention for Mr. Mnuchin.In 2006, he and a partner, Chip Seelig, struck a deal through their company DuneEntertainment to invest $325 million in 28 movies produced by 20th Century Fox.It was a successful partnership; Fox delivered hits (made in part with Dune'smoney) like "Avatar," which took in $2.8 billion worldwide in 2009.After breaking with Mr. Seelig in 2012, Mr. Mnuchin teamed up with a companycalled RatPac, owned by the rowdy filmmaker Brett Ratner and the Australianbillionaire James Packer. Mr. Ratner was then notorious in Hollywood; heresigned as a producer of the Academy Awards in 2011 after using an anti-gayslur at a public event and making frank remarks about his sex life on HowardStern's radio show. (He apologized.) But together the three men formed a vehicleto invest $450 million in an extensive array of Warner Bros. movies.Some have been major hits, like "Gravity," which took in $723.2 million. Butthere have also been money losers, including "Pan" and "In the Heart of theSea."Still, Mr. Mnuchin has clearly enjoyed a Hollywood lifestyle, whether attendingcelebrity-filled parties at the Hôtel du Cap-Eden-Roc during the Cannes FilmFestival or going in with a movie industry friend to buy a Dassault Falcon 50jet (since sold). He can currently be seen in a cameo - playing a Merrill Lynchexecutive - in Warren Beatty's new movie "Rules Don't Apply."Beyond the entertainment industry, there other similarities between Mr. Trumpand Mr. Mnuchin. They are both twice divorced, and their third partners aredecidedly younger. (Mr. Mnuchin's fiancée is Louise Linton, a 34-year-oldactress from Scotland.) They also both have a taste for landmark Manhattan realestate: Trump Tower for the president-elect and 740 Park Avenue for Mr. Mnuchin.But there are differences, too. Despite his Hollywood appetites, Mr. Mnuchin isdescribed by people who know him as slightly awkward and not one to command aroom. Friends of the two men describe them more as social and professionalacquaintances than close friends.The names of flashier prospects had been floated as possible candidates forTreasury, according to a fund manager close to the president-elect's economicbrain trust. Among them: Henry Kravis of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company,Jonathan Gray of Blackstone, Jamie Dimon, Mitt Romney, and Thomas J. Barrack Jr.of Colony Capital, a Los Angeles-based real estate investor who has been closeto Mr. Trump for decades.Brooks Barnes and Neil Irwin contributed reporting.PHOTOS: Wilbur Ross was tapped for the Commerce Department.
