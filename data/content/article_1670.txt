By Lisa Riley RocheDeseret NewsSALT LAKE CITY - Now that President-elect Donald Trump has made it clear hedoesn't want to pursue an investigation into rival Hillary Clinton, will Rep.Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, go forward with his promised probe?Chaffetz, chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee,declined to comment on Trump's new stand, spelled out during an interviewTuesday with reporters and editors at the New York Times.But Trump's decision to "move forward" from his threat to go after theDemocratic presidential nominee from the White House may mean that Chaffetz isrethinking his committee's look into Clinton's use of a private email server assecretary of state."I think he's in a tight spot," said Chris Karpowitz of the BYU Center for theStudy of Elections and Democracy. "That type of action tends to look like you'regoing after political enemies, not serving the legitimate oversight duties ofCongress."The center's co-director said with a new Republican administration and continuedGOP control of Congress, "continuing to rehash the ethical challenges of HillaryClinton will seem petty and hyperpartisan."Particularly since Democrats, including the committee's ranking member, Rep.Elijah Cummings, D-Maryland, are already calling for a review of Trump'sfinances for potential conflicts of interest between his business empire and thepresidency."Significant questions have been raised about how the Trump administration isgoing to balance private business interests with the public interest," Karpowitzsaid, but it is unclear if those will be pursued "with the same doggedness andvigor."Sutherland Institute President Boyd Matheson, however, said Chaffetz has alreadyhelped shift the committee from being seen as "nothing more than witch huntcentral" for whatever party was in power in Congress.Still, he said, it won't be easy balancing Trump's signaled desire to focus onother issues rather than "risk a petty, political, poking around" into Clinton'semails and family foundation with calls to dig into the new president'sfinances.Chaffetz will "definitely be the one at the tip of the spear on that," Mathesonsaid, but he also has an opportunity to elevate the committee "in a way that'sbetter for the country. That's huge. That's a heavy lift."Trump told the Times that "we'll have people do things," suggesting that couldmean some sort of continued investigation of Clinton, even though that will notbe a priority for the new administration."I don't want to hurt the Clintons, I really don't," Trump said, despite dubbingthe former secretary of state "Crooked Hillary" and leading chants to "lock herup" during the campaign.Trump said that Clinton "went through a lot and suffered greatly in manydifferent ways" in what he termed a "vicious" campaign that saw him pledgeduring a debate to appoint a special prosecutor with the intent of putting herin jail.Even before Trump's Nov. 8 victory, Chaffetz said his committee would not haltits investigation into whether Clinton's private email server threatenednational security.He said he was under increased security after receiving death threats forannouncing shortly before the election that the FBI had reopened its caseagainst Clinton because of a letter to congressional leaders about reviewingadditional emails.The review turned up nothing new, and Clinton blamed her loss on the attentionit drew to the FBI's earlier investigation that had concluded in July she shouldnot be criminally prosecuted.The day after the election, Chaffetz said it would "be totally remiss" for thecommittee to dismiss its investigation because Clinton would not be president.He had said he did not expect to call Clinton to testify."I still have a duty and obligation to get to the truth about one of the largestbreaches of security at the State Department," Chaffetz told the WashingtonPost. "Tens of thousands of documents still have not been turned over toCongress."Chaffetz initially backed away from his support of Trump after a 2005 videosurfaced of a conversation Trump had with a TV host describing in graphic termsmaking sexual advances on women.But in late October, shortly after telling the Post the committee had "twoyears' worth of material already lined up" should Clinton become president,Chaffetz said he would vote for Trump after all.In a tweet, the Utah congressman said then that he "will not defend or endorse(Trump) but I am voting for him. HRC (Hillary Rodham Clinton) is that bad. HRCis bad for the USA."Email: lisa@deseretnews.comTwitter: DNewsPolitics
