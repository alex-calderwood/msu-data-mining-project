If Hanover businesses want legislators to evaluate regulations affecting theirindustry, now is the time to say so.That was the advice given to a room of Hanover's community leaders Friday by BobReilly, the deputy chief of staff for U.S. Rep. Scott Perry, R-Carroll Township.About 30 business owners and elected officials gathered at Dutch Countryrestaurant in Penn Township Friday to talk about the relationship betweengovernment and business. The quarterly event, which is organized by the HanoverChamber of Commerce, is designed to open the lines of communication between thetwo groups.The round table discussion Friday focused on the results of the 2016presidential, county and state elections and how the outcome might affect localbusinesses, education and the Hanover community.Bipartisan cooperation will be necessary to accomplish any political goals inthe coming years, Reilly said. He pointed to President Barack Obama's use ofexecutive orders to establish policy instead of compromising with legislators."We can't make the mistake President Obama did with the executive orders," hesaid. "We have to learn that we can disagree on these issues."Since Donald Trump won the presidential election at the beginning of November,local businesses have been looking ahead at some of the president-elect'scampaign promises, which were outlined in the 100-day plan he delivered inGettysburg on Nov. 10.One of Trump's proposed requirements was that for every new federal regulation,two existing regulations must be eliminated.Reilly pointed to the Affordable Health Care Act and the recent change to theFair Labor Standard Act's overtime pay requirement, which he said many localbusinesses have asked him about, as regulations that could be re-evaluated inthe coming term.In addition to Reilly's talk, elected officials such as Pennsylvania State Rep.Kate Klunk (R-Hanover) and Rep. Will Tallman (R - Adams/Cumberland) debriefedthe crowd on some of their goals and hopes for the state budget in 2017.Both representatives took questions from the business community members, whichcovered topics such as supporting Pennsylvania's children and youth services,stimulating commercial investments and reforming government pensions.Klunk was adamant that even if changes in spending and regulations are made on afederal level, work would still have to be done at the state level as well."We work very, very well together between York and Adams counties," Klunk said."We get a lot done when we work together."
