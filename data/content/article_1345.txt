As President-elect Donald Trump continued the work of forming his newadministration Sunday, aides struggled with some of the baggage he carries withhim -- especially how to separate his business interests from government and theinflammatory rhetoric about Muslims that marked his campaign.Trump met with a series of men -- and one woman -- who may be underconsideration for high-level appointments.Among them were campaign loyalists including Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former NewYork mayor, and Chris Christie, the governor of New Jersey, but also someoutsiders, such as Jonathan Gray, a Wall Street executive and prominentDemocratic donor, and Robert Johnson, the founder of the Black EntertainmentTelevision cable network."We've made a couple of deals," the president-elect said late in the day toreporters waiting at his golf resort in Bedminster, N.J., indicating thatfurther Cabinet announcements could come soon.Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-Wash.), a member of the House GOP leadership, wasthe only woman on Sunday's list, which also included Ari Emanuel, the prominentHollywood agent and brother of President Obama's former White House chief ofstaff, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel."Great guy. Great friend of mine," Trump said.While busy with his transition, the president-elect has found time recently forother meetings, including one with three investors from India who are partnerswith him in a luxury complex outside Mumbai.A spokesperson for Trump insisted that the meeting, first reported by the NewYork Times, was just a courtesy call, but it renewed questions about how Trumpcould avoid conflicts of interest while retaining an ownership stake in hisfar-flung network of businesses.Vice President-elect Mike Pence insisted in a television interview Sunday thatTrump would "create the proper separation."In an interview with "Fox News Sunday," Pence said lawyers and experts wereworking on how to successfully untangle Trump's holdings from the presidency."I'm very confident working with the best legal minds in the country that thepresident-elect and his family will create the proper separation from hisbusiness going forward," Pence told host Chris Wallace.Trump has said he will allow his adult children to run his business ventures;government watchdogs have said he should divest his holdings or set up a blindtrust.Among the potential problems: Trump's company has operations in other countries,often in connection with foreign governments that could steer money toward hisfamily in an effort to influence his decisions.In addition to the meeting with the Indian business executives, Trump and hisfamily came under criticism when his daughter Ivanka attended thepresident-elect's first face-to-face meeting with a foreign head of government,the prime minister of Japan.Her jewelry company also caused a stir by sending an email to reportersfeaturing a photograph of the $10,000 bracelet she wore during a postelectiontelevision interview with her father.At a news conference in Lima, Peru, where he was winding up a summit of leadersfrom Asia and the Pacific, President Obama pointedly noted that hisadministration had managed to go eight years without a major ethics scandalbecause White House lawyers had insisted that he and his aides "not just meetthe letter of the law."Obama said he had advised Trump to appoint a strong White House counsel whowould insist on similar care.While Trump aides continued to deal with questions about potential conflicts,they also faced controversy over some of their remarks about Islam.Reince Priebus, Trump's designee to be the White House chief of staff, defendedremarks made by retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, Trump's national securityadvisor, that criticized Islam."Clearly there are some aspects of that faith that are problematic," Priebussaid during an interview on ABC's "This Week."Asked about Flynn's statement that Islam was a political ideology masked behinda religion, Priebus said that "phrasing can always be done differently."But he praised Flynn as "an unbelievably gifted, smart person" who has Trump'sconfidence.In an interview on NBC's "Meet the Press," Priebus said that Trump believes that"no faith in and of itself should be judged as a whole. But there are somepeople in countries abroad that ... need to be prevented from coming into thiscountry."Asked about Trump's suggestion earlier in the campaign year that Muslims mightbe required to register with government officials, Priebus avoided a clearanswer."I'm not going to rule out anything. But, but I wouldn't -- we're not going tohave a registry based on a religion," he said. "But what I think what we'retrying to do is say that there are some people, certainly not all people ...there are some people that are radicalized, and there are some people that haveto be prevented from coming into this country."The country's largest Muslim advocacy group condemned the remarks as examples ofIslamophobia."Our nation is not served by the denigration of Islam or by the introduction ofineffective and discriminatory policies targeting Muslims," said Robert McCaw,government affairs director for the Council on American-Islamic Relations.Trump's weekend in New Jersey has seen a steady parade of visitors, includingsome past critics. On Saturday, Trump and Pence spoke with Mitt Romney, whomPence described as a potential secretary of State pick.During the campaign, the 2012 GOP presidential candidate had been highlycritical of Trump's character and policies.Pence said Romney was under "active consideration" to head the State Department."The president-elect was very grateful that Mitt Romney came in," he added,describing the hourlong meeting as a "warm and substantive exchange" of ideas.He and Trump also met with retired Marine Gen. James Mattis, a former warcommander in Iraq and Afghanistan who has been critical of some Obamaadministration policies and has the nickname "Mad Dog Mattis." He is beingconsidered to lead the Pentagon as Defense secretary.Trump tweeted Sunday that Mattis "was very impressive yesterday. A trueGeneral's General!"In his interview with Fox News, Pence also addressed the controversy surroundinghis attendance at the hit Broadway show "Hamilton." He was cheered and jeered ashe entered the theater Friday, and after the performance, the actor playingAaron Burr gave a brief speech about American values directed at Pence.Trump took to Twitter the next day -- and again Sunday -- to chastise the show'scast and demand an apology.The dispute flew across social media over the weekend, sparking the hashtag#boycotthamilton.Trump's tweets appeared to continue a pattern he established in the campaign inwhich he would use Twitter to change the subject away from headlines that werepotentially damaging.His tweets about Hamilton diverted at least some attention from the criticism ofhis naming of Stephen K. Bannon to be a senior White House official and the $25million he agreed to pay to settle claims that his Trump University real estateseminars had defrauded students.Pence, also following a pattern from the campaign, took a more conciliatoryline. He said he had heard the remarks by actor Brandon Victor Dixon and was notoffended by them.A self-described history buff, Pence said he enjoyed the musical."It is a great, great show," he said, calling it an "incredible production" by"incredibly talented people.""It was a real joy to be there," he added.--del.wilber@latimes.comTwitter: @delwilberdavid.lauter@latimes.comTwitter: @DavidLauter
