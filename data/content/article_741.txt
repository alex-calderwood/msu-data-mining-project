Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein maintained today that her recountefforts in three states that swung narrowly for President-elect Donald Trump onElection Day are rooted in fighting "electoral racism," despite opposition fromher own running mate-who warned the audits could undermine the larger waragainst "two racist, capitalist/imperialist parties."After a successful crowdfunding campaign to raise the necessary money, Steinfiled a petition for a review of votes cast in Wisconsin on November 28, and didthe same three days later in Pennsylvania and in Michigan just two days ago. TheClinton campaign announced it would join the recount effort.  Trump's lawyershave  filed petitions in all three states to block Stein's recount efforts.Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette, a Republican, has also announced thathe is filing a lawsuit to stop the recount.Green vice presidential contender Ajamu Baraka has warned that the efforts riskmaking the party appear a tool of the Democrats, an anxiety Stein told theObserver she understood."I share those concerns," Stein said in an interview at the National Women'sPolitical Caucus of NYC's 2016 New York State Conference of Civically EngagedWomen this afternoon. "I think it's a real judgement call. It's very importantthat we maintain our political independence as a political party and we have towork very hard to clarify: this is not politically motivated.""It's a judgement call and it also, it also lets the momentum of the Green Partythat we worked very hard to build during the race, it puts it on hold for acouple of weeks, not for the whole party but for, you know, my part of it,"Stein continued.Stein-who promoted herself as a candidate who could continue Vermont Sen. BernieSanders' political revolution during the campaign-noted that requests forrecounts are made at the behest of individual candidates, not parties. She alsoasserted that campaigns don't ask for permission from political parties and thatthey have to make decisions "very quickly.""The Green Party doesn't have a decision-making process for a question likethis, and the discussion that it has triggered is still ongoing and the jury isstill out," she said. "Some people voiced their disapproval but lots of peoplealso voiced their approval. This is actually part of the Green Party platform."Trump recently claimed, without proof, that "millions of people" cast  ballotsillegally, a statement in keeping with his campaign trail claims that theelection would be "rigged." Stein insisted that her effort is targeting adifferent beast.Stein said voting mechanics are insecure, unreliable and have a "built-in racistdimension to them" because the equipment does not get funded or maintained wellin poorer areas-communities where she said "tens of thousands of votes orthousands of votes fall through the cracks," particularly in communities ofcolor.  She called Trump's claims "the opposite of reality.""The problem is not-and many studies have shown this-the problem is not thatpeople are voting illegally or they're voting twice or they're voting acrossstate borders," Stein said. "There's absolutely zero evidence of that but whatthere is evidence of is that millions of voters have been illegally taken offthe voter rolls.""This is on behalf of voters, especially communities of color who are most atrisk for being shafted through electoral racism," she added.During her speech, she railed against Clinton and Trump, saying that theelection saw "most people voting against a candidate they were frightened ofrather than a candidate they really supported."She said the two parties have wasted money on wars, that Wall Street and the 1percent are benefiting from Trump's election, blasted Clinton's position onfracking, called for open presidential debates and noted wage inequality forwomen of color.She claimed that Trump received more than $4 billion in free primetime media,compared to more than $2 billion for Clinton and roughly $0.5 billion forSanders, her primary opponent-but that she was squashed out."My campaign got essentially zip, almost nothing while I was running foroffice," Stein told the audience. "Now that I'm not running for office anymore,suddenly the doors of the media are quite open, but not when there was actuallya real threat that could empower everyday people to stand up and also to hearour issues discussed."Asked afterward if she would seek the presidency a third time in 2020, Steintold the Observer "who knows."Disclosure: Donald Trump is the father-in-law of Jared Kushner, the publisher ofObserver Media.
