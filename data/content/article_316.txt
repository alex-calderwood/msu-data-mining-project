MADISON, Wis. - President-elect Donald Trump pressed forward Friday withtwo more administration picks, as failed Green Party candidate Jill Stein tooknew-teps to force recounts across key Midwestern battlegrounds that couldcomplicate Trump's push for national unity.Stein, who earned little more than 1 percent of the national vote, formallyrequested a Wisconsin recount Friday afternoon, vowing to do the same in thecoming days in Michigan and Pennsylvania. Wisconsin officials confirmed Fridayevening they would move forward with the first presidential recount in statehistory. There is no evidence of election tampering in the states where Trumpscored razor-thin victories, but Green Party spokesman George Martin insisted"the American public needs to have it investigated to make sure our votes count."We're doing this to ensure the integrity of our system, he said.Trump's team ignored questions about the looming recounts. Set to assume thepresidency in 55 days, he was focused instead on the daunting task of buildingan administration from scratch.Gathered with family at his Mar-a-Lago Palm Beach estate for the holidayweekend, the incoming president made two senior-level staff appointments andscheduled meetings with several more prospective administration officials.He tapped Fox News analyst Kathleen Troia "KT McFarland to serve as deputynational security adviser and campaign attorney Donald McGahn as White Housecounsel. In a statement, Trump cited McFarland's "tremendous experience andinnate talent and said McGhan "has a brilliant legal mind, excellent characterand a deep understanding of constitutional law.Having faced criticism about the inexperience of his initial picks, Trump findsin McFarland someone who previously worked under three presidents, although nonesince Ronald Reagan. McGhan, a veteran Republican election lawyer, served asTrump's attorney during the campaign.Neither position requires Senate confirmation.Trump transition spokesman Sean Spicer said the president-elect scheduled Mondaymeetings with eight more prospective administration hires, a group that includesseveral business leaders, Pennsylvania Rep. Lou Barletta, and David Clarke, theWisconsin sheriff who is an aggressive opponent of the Black Lives Mattermovement.Facing external pressure from Stein, there were also signs of internal discordwithin the president-elect's small inner circle as Trump weighed his choices forsecretary of state.The options for the nation's chief diplomat include former New York City MayorRudy Giuliani, who lacks foreign policy experience but was intensely loyal toTrump, and 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, who aggressivelyopposed Trump's candidacy but is largely regarded as more qualified.Trump spokeswoman Kellyanne Conway took the unusual step of shining light on thecontroversy over the Thanksgiving holiday, tweeting that she had been "receivinga deluge of social media & private concerns re: Romney Some Trump loyalists warnagainst Romney as sec of state.Meanwhile, Stein announced on her website she has raised enough money to fundrecounts in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania and was pursuing additional funding to dothe same in Michigan.Trump's Nov. 8 victory was unexpected and historic, by some measures.Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton leads the national popular vote by close to 2million votes. Trump scored narrow victories in key battleground states,however, giving him the necessary 270 electoral votes to assume the presidency.He won in Pennsylvania. He won in Wisconsin, breaking a Democratic winningstreak dating back 32 years. He holds a slim lead in Michigan, where aRepublican presidential candidate hadn't won since 1988; The Associated Pressstill hasn't officially called that race.Wisconsin, where Trump leads by little more than 22,000 votes, has never beforeconducted a presidential recount. It will this year, state administrator MichaelHaas announced Friday, citing recount requests by Stein and independentcandidate Rocky De La Fuente."The Commission is preparing to move forward with a statewide recount of votesfor President of the United States, as requested by these candidates, Haas said,noting that the recount is expected to be completed by the Dec. 13 federaldeadline.In Michigan, Trump's 10,704-vote lead is expected to be certified by the stateelections board Monday. The deadline to ask for a recount is Wednesday.A statewide recount would cost Stein roughly $790,000, said Fred Woodhams, aspokesman for the Michigan secretary of state. An opposing candidate would haveseven days to file objections to the recount petition, after which the boardwould schedule a public hearing and later issue a ruling on the objections.Trump's transition team indicated he was focused on the challenges of governing.Since arriving at his Palm Beach estate Wednesday, they said, thepresident-elect has spoken to the prime ministers of Greece, Hungary and Sweden,along with the presidents of Panama and Slovenia.He is expected to return to his New York City home on Sunday.Associated Press writer David Eggert in Lansing, Michigan, contributed to thisreport.
