WASHINGTON - Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito issued a rallying cry toconservatives Thursday amid newfound strength following Donald Trump's election.Alito told the Federalist Society conference of conservative lawyers, judges andlegal thinkers that religious freedom and gun rights are among "constitutionalfault lines," important issues at stake in the federal courts.The conference of 1,800 of conservatism's leading lights took on a new air ofimportance with Trump's victory and included a list of judges thepresident-elect has named as candidates to fill the vacancy created by the deathlast February of Justice Antonin Scalia.In his remarks, Alito didn't mention the election or the vacancy, rather usingthe platform to pay tribute to Scalia, a longtime colleague and conservativeally in high court battles on hot-button social and political issues.He said Scalia, a hero to many of the group's 40,000 members, is sorely missedon the court. "We are left to ask ourselves WWSD," what would Scalia do, Alitosaid. The lettering is a play on the phrase "WWJD," for what would Jesus do.In the halls of the conference there was little formal talk of the election orthe fight to seat a new justice. But attendees packed a lunchtime panelmoderated by Michigan Supreme Court Justice Joan Larsen, one of 21 people onTrump's list, and the Supreme Court vacancy was the talk of hallway chatteramong lawyers who ranged from Trump backers to those who proclaimed they wouldnever vote for him.Larsen served as a Supreme Court law clerk to Scalia and said he valued hisclerks' frank assessment of his work. "It was a formidable task to stand up toJustice Scalia and say, 'You have gone too far.' But he valued that," Larsensaid.Later, she declined to discuss her status on Trump's list, saying she intends tocomplete her state court term, which runs through 2021. "That's really where myfocus lies," she said in a brief conversation with The Associated Press.Other sessions were moderated by Minnesota Supreme Court Justice David Stras andfederal appellate judges William Pryor and Thomas Hardiman, all on Trump's list.Before the conference ends Saturday, nine judges on the list are expected toappear.The court has been operating with eight justices since Scalia's death becauseSenate Republicans blocked action on President Barack Obama's nomination ofJudge Merrick Garland.Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas also was on the schedule at theconference, which has turned into an impromptu job fair for spots in the newadministration."The mood has changed. Everyone is going to be thinking, 'Maybe someone here isgoing to be filling Justice Scalia's shoes,'" said Abbe Gluck, a Yale Lawprofessor who is not a member of the group but will participate in theconference.The Federalist Society got its start on college campuses when Ronald Reagan wasin the White House.It was conceived as a way to counter what its members saw as liberal dominationof the nation's law school faculties. Its influence was pronounced during thepresidency of George W. Bush, when its leaders helped rally support for Senateconfirmation of Alito and Chief Justice John Roberts. The group was sosuccessful that it spawned copycat liberal organizations.Nan Aron, the president of Alliance for Justice, said the Federalist Society"promotes a way of looking at the law which upholds the rights of the powerfuland the wealthy." Aron said it is "regrettable that so many nominees on Trump'slist are going to attend Federalist Society events."Yet a conservative legal scholar who has been critical of Trump said the group'sinvolvement in identifying candidates for judgeships and other jobs in the newadministration is not something to fear."In fact, if the Federalist Society does play a role in identifying thepresident-elect's nominees, that could be comforting to some who havereservations about Donald Trump's administration, because such a role wouldsuggest, at least in this area, continuity with long-standing, mainstreamRepublican practice," University of Notre Dame law professor Richard Garnettsaid in an email.
