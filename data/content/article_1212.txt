HIGHLIGHT:Â This year's class for the Presidential Medal of Freedom spared noexpense. Two basketball players? Why not?Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. Robert De Niro. Bill and Melinda Gates. Cicely Tyson. EllenDeGeneres. Bruce Springsteen, Diana Ross. The list goes on. It was a lot. Infact, this might be the best class ever to receive the Presidential Medal ofFreedom.Wesley declares it "the single most moving cultural experience I had this year"on the latest episode of Still Processing. He is joined by Alex Pappademas, withwhom he used to co-host a podcast called "Do You Like Prince Movies?" They openby discussing President Obama's Presidential Medal of Freedom awards."It was an embarrassment of riches," Alex says. "It's as if they had a masterlist of who they wanted to give these awards to and then they just gave it toall of them."Wesley agrees: "There is a kind of Noah's Ark aspect to this.""You have Michael Jordan and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar," Alex says. "It was like, 'Wedon't have to make the hard choices here for one person representing one field.We can have two basketball players here. Why not, let's do it.' "But for all the joy of having these superstars gathered in one place, Alex saysthat he was "sort of melancholy about it.""It feels like a last statement, a last cultural statement, from this WhiteHouse, from this administration, from the Obama era," he says. "This is going tobe a very, very different party next year."We also share our feelings on the singer The Weeknd.
