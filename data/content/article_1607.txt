But for millions of women who've taken proactive steps to preventunplanned pregnancy, there's a much more direct threat: the next administrationcoming after their birth control.As organizations like Planned Parenthood put out urgent calls for resources andsupport, ordinary women are asking: What do we do if we no longer have access toaffordable birth control next year?For many, the answer could be to get an intrauterine device, or IUD.These tiny devices last either three or five years, depending on the model.Shaped like a small "T" with a thin string attached, they feature a variety ofcombinations of hormones and come with a near-perfect guarantee to preventpregnancy.After a short procedure, the IUD stays put for years without any muss or fuss.No hustling to take a pill at the same precise time each day, no anxiety aboutmissing a dose, and no worries about getting a full period each month.In short, the IUD is a great option for many women - and particularly attractivein the face of a possible near future without birth control access.Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, most insurance plans are required to coverthe cost of prescription birth control, including IUDs. That means no co-pays,deductibles, or out-of-pocket costs. Unfortunately, Republicans have repeatedlytried to gut the Affordable Care Act, and they'll have an ally in the nextpresident.If Congress dumps Obamacare, some 20 million people - including over 250,000people who have signed up since the election - could be left without the meansto access proper healthcare, including reproductive healthcare.Meanwhile, other lawmakers are attempting to deny women the right to birthcontrol point-blank. Laws like the proposed Russell Amendment would let doctors,pharmaceutical employees, and other health care providers claim a religiousright to refuse to provide birth control. Employers could even fire workers forusing birth control on their own dime.With their reproductive rights at stake, it's no wonder many women are hedgingtheir bets right now and looking for a long-term birth control option.Ninety-nine percent of women of reproductive age have used some form of birthcontrol.That includes women of all religious, ethnic, and cultural backgrounds, from allwalks of life, and with all sorts of life experiences. From young women withmedical conditions that affect their hormones to teenagers to mothers ofmultiple children, we run the gamut.It's not just cis-gender women - transgender, agender, and intersex people usebirth control, too.And we aren't about to let anyone take our access to affordable birth controlaway."The pill" has been around since the 1960s - and so, I was surprised to learn,has the IUD. We are the many, the proud, and we're not willing to go back to thetime when back-alley abortions, coat hangers, and turpentine were acceptablemethods of reproductive healthcare in the United States.We're not willing to go back to a time when women didn't have control over theirown bodies.If you're considering using a long-term birth control method and have anyquestions, ask me - or anyone else in your community who may know the answers.Or check out bedsider.org, an online resource recommended by women's healthcareproviders. There are millions of us out there happy to reach out.If, on the other hand, you seek to deny us the right to choose what to do withour bodies, remember: We have a voice, and we will not be silent. History is onour side.Olivia Alperstein is the Communications and Policy Associate of ProgressiveCongress.
