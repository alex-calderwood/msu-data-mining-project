HIGHLIGHT:Â President-elect Donald Trump, shown during his meeting this monthwith President Barack Obama, will be back in New York today to discuss moreadministration hires.Pablo Martinez Monsivais/Associated PressWEST PALM BEACH, Fla. - President-elect Donald Trump claimed without evidenceSunday that "millions" voted illegally in the national election, scoffing atHillary Clinton's nearly 2 million-voter edge in the popular vote and returningto his campaign accusation of a rigged race even as he prepares to enter theWhite House in less than two months.Trump and his aides assailed an effort - now joined by Clinton - to recountvotes in up to three battleground states, calling the push fraudulent, the workof "crybabies" and, in Trump's estimation, "sad."The president-elect went on to cast a shadow over the legitimacy of an electionthat he won, tweeting that "I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions ofpeople who voted illegally." He further contended that if the popular votedetermined the presidency, "It would have been much easier for me to win" itbecause he would have altered his campaign to pile up overall vote totals, notElectoral College votes.There's been no indication of widespread vote manipulation, illegal voting orhacking that materially affected the outcome one way or the other. That lack ofevidence suggests that Trump is likely to prevail in recounts.As Trump worked to fill foreign policy and national security posts in hisCabinet, a top adviser expressed astonishment that 2012 GOP presidential nomineeMitt Romney remained under consideration for secretary of state after hiscampaign-long questioning of Trump's character, intellect and integrity.On Sunday, Trump tweeted part of Clinton's concession speech, when she toldsupporters they must accept that "Donald Trump is going to be our president,"and snippets from her debate remarks, when she denounced the Republican nomineefor refusing to say in advance that he would accept the Election Day verdict.This came on top of his saying it was a "scam" that Green Party nominee JillStein was revisiting the vote count in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania.Trump won Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, and as of Wednesday, held a lead of almost11,000 votes in Michigan, with the results awaiting state certification today.His Michigan margin was a hair's-breadth 0.22 percent of the state's votes.Clinton leads the national popular vote by close to 2 million votes, but Trumpwon 290 electoral votes to Clinton's 232, not counting Michigan. She couldconceivably tip the electoral balance in the remote event that all flipped toher in recounts.Trump planned to return to New York on Sunday after spending Thanksgivingweekend at his West Palm Beach estate. His transition team said thepresident-elect had scheduled a series of meetings today with prospectiveadministration hires.Among the jobs Trump has yet to fill: secretary of state. Internal division overthe position again spilled out into the open Sunday as Trump senior adviserKellyanne Conway voiced her concerns over the possibility of Romney landing sucha significant position.Trump supporters "feel a bit betrayed that you can get a Romney back in thereafter everything he did," Conway said. "We don't even know if he voted forDonald Trump. He and his consultants were nothing but awful to Donald Trump fora year." She added that she was "reflecting what the grass-roots are saying."Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani and Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker are amongother prospects to serve as the country's top diplomat."I'm all for party unity, but I'm not sure we have to pay for that with thesecretary of state position," Conway said.Trump's incoming chief of staff, national party Chairman Reince Priebus,acknowledged that Romney would represent "a 'team of rivals' concept."Trump was mostly silent on the brewing recount effort until it became known thatClinton would join it, at least in Wisconsin. On Saturday, a day after Wisconsinofficials said they would conduct the first presidential recount in the state'shistory, Clinton campaign attorney Marc Elias said: "We intend to participate inorder to ensure the process proceeds in a manner that is fair to all sides."Elias said Clinton would take the same approach in Pennsylvania and Michigan ifStein were to follow through with recount requests in those states.That loosened Trump's tongue."Hillary Clinton conceded the election when she called me just prior to thevictory speech and after the results were in," Trump tweeted Sunday. "Nothingwill change."He quoted from her concession speech - "We owe him an open mind and the chanceto lead" - and he concluded: "So much time and money will be spent - sameresult! Sad."On NBC's "Meet the Press," Conway said Stein, "the Hillary people" and otherssupporting recounts have to decide whether they are going to back a peacefultransition "or if they're going to be a bunch of crybabies and sore losers aboutan election that they can't turn around."Priebus, on "Fox News Sunday," called the effort a "total and completedistraction and a fraud and something that they should drop."Clinton's lawyer said her team has been combing through the results since theelection in search of anomalies that would suggest hacking by Russians or othersand found "no actionable evidence" of an altered outcome. Moreover, Elias said,Trump has a vote lead even in the closest states that well exceeds the largestmargin ever overcome in a recount.But "we feel it is important, on principle, to ensure our campaign is legallyrepresented in any court proceedings and represented on the ground in order tomonitor the recount process itself," he said.Trump beat Clinton in Wisconsin by fewer than 22,200 votes, less than 1 percentof votes cast. He won Pennsylvania by some 70,600 votes, just more than 1percentage point over Clinton.
