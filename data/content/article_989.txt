HARTFORD, Conn. -- The incumbent governor ran on a kindness platform and is justfinishing up a year of public appearances and speeches. The candidates vying tosucceed her are focusing their campaigns on issues including homelessness,recycling and bullying prevention.Welcome to politics, elementary-school style.Seven candidates are running to be the fifth-grade "kid governor" of Connecticutin an election that seeks to spark deeper interest for all students ingovernment and civics, subjects getting less attention in American schools todaythan in earlier decades.Similar efforts have sprouted as education-focused nonprofits and schools aim toprepare better-engaged citizens. Advocates say a need for more civic instructionhas been apparent for years butsee pupils/page a11was highlighted by the low voter turnout and acrid tone in the presidential racebetween Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump."Effective civics learning promotes civil discourse. Effective civics learninghelps students develop the ability to discuss controversial issues respectfully.That seemed to be in very short supply in the election we've just gone through,"said Ted McConnell, executive director of the Campaign for the Civic Mission ofSchools. "Basic civics knowledge is wanting throughout our country."After years of decline, many efforts are underway to restore the role advocatessay schools were intended to play in teaching students their rights andresponsibilities as citizens.The decline in schools began in the 1950s and accelerated in the 2000s asschools emphasized courses with more bearing on testing under No Child LeftBehind, McConnell said. Where high schools once taught three civics courses, hesaid, it is generally down to one.-- Illinois, which had been among less than a dozen states without a civicsrequirement, required at least a semester of instruction for students tograduate beginning this year.-- Nonprofit groups such as Generation Citizen and Discovering Justice havemobilized volunteers to help high school teachers run action-oriented civicsprojects and teach the importance of good citizenship.-- States including California, Connecticut and New York have updated theirsocial studies frameworks to put more emphasis on civics and participatoryskills.In Connecticut, 4,400 fifth-graders from 45 cities and towns voted to choose thekid governor. The program, which also includes in-class lessons about governmentand engaging with community issues, was launched last year by the ConnecticutPublic Affairs Network, with sponsorship by the state Department of Education.The winner serves a one-year term. Responsibilities include developing a plan todeliver on campaign promises, keeping up a blog highlighting other students'efforts to make a difference, and making public appearances and speeches.The current kid governor, Elena Tipton, 11, of East Hartford, was elected lastyear on a kindness platform. She said she originally planned a campaign focusedon bullying prevention, but said that would be giving bullies the attention thatthey want."The best part about it is that I get to go around and meet all these differentpeople and learn what they do to be kind," Elena said.Research has shown that civics education, including discussions of currentevents, increases the likelihood young people will vote, said Peter Levine, anassociate dean at the Jonathan M. Tisch College of Civic Life at TuftsUniversity. There also is evidence, he said, that when children are engaged,their parents are more likely to vote.The framework adopted last year in Connecticut urges schools to teach civicsthroughout the curriculum, and not just in high school. A new initiative withthe secretary of the state's office will recognize schools that taught the 2016elections in innovative ways.Brian Cofrancesco, who runs the kid governor program, said it helps childrenunderstand the democratic process and the value of their own voice."Kids are realizing," he said, "every vote really does matter."
