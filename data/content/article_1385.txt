Before election day, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti didn't hold back when itcame to Donald Trump."He's a racist. He's a bigot. He's sexist," Garcetti told reporters in May,criticizing the Republican presidential hopeful for his views on the economy,immigration and women, among other things. "What we cannot do with Donald Trumpis normalize him as a candidate."That kind of criticism was common for Democratic leaders in deep-blueCalifornia, where slamming Trump brought few political risks.But since Trump's victory, Garcetti has adopted a more civil tone. They spoke byphone last week, and Garcetti has expressed his willingness to work with thepresident-elect on infrastructure and the economy.At the same time, Garcetti has offered assurances that the city won't aid Trumpon any widespread crackdown against immigrants who are in the country withoutauthorization.It amounts to a political tightrope walk by Garcetti -- an approach that couldhelp the city in significant ways but may disappoint groups that want the mayorto take a harder line against Trump, especially on immigration."If Trump plays him for a fool, Garcetti is going to look bad," said BrentWilkes, national executive director of the League of United Latin AmericanCitizens. "And there will be progressives that are angry that he didn't take atougher stance."Garcetti represents a city slated to receive $500 million in federal fundingthis year -- money for homeless shelters, port security and more. The city isalso locked in an international competition to bring the 2024 Olympics to LosAngeles.He's also one of several mayors who represent large, diverse Democratic-majoritycities who now must work with a Republican-controlled Congress and White House.But unlike New York's Bill de Blasio or Chicago's Rahm Emanuel, Garcetti doesn'thave a "rough temper," said Jaime Regalado, emeritus professor of politicalscience at Cal State L.A."Eric's not one to pick fights," Regalado said. "He's one to make things work bybuilding consensus, by working behind the scenes."Flanked by teens at a Boyle Heights high school last week, Garcetti seemed toappeal directly to Trump as he talked about deportation concerns. According toLos Angeles school board President Steve Zimmer, about one-fourth of L.A.Unified's 600,000 students are in the country without legal permission or have afamily member with that status."I'm hoping his heart will be touched by understanding that we have folks whoare undocumented that serve in our armed forces," Garcetti said. "That we havefamilies that are blended ... different status."In contrast, de Blasio delivered a 40-minute address in front of hundreds ofcity workers, politicians and faith leaders that same day in New York, vowing tosue if Muslims are required to register and to assist women if PlannedParenthood of New York lost federal funding.De Blasio also launched a hashtag, #AlwaysNewYork, seen as symbol of resistanceto Trump's presidency.Emanuel also garnered headlines when he said Chicago would remain a "sanctuarycity" for immigrants.Garcetti refuses to call Los Angeles a "sanctuary city," saying the term is notaccurate.The phrase dates to the 1980s, when U.S. immigration policies allowed someCentral American immigrants entry, but not others. In response, Berkeley and afew other municipalities declared themselves "sanctuary cities" to accept thosemigrants.Some L.A. immigration groups say Garcetti should declare Los Angeles a"sanctuary city," technical inaccuracy or not."I know he's a professor and that's where he comes from, and he's trying toeducate people about sanctuary cities," said Angelica Salas, executive directorof the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles, referencingGarcetti's past work teaching at Occidental College. "But let's just embrace it,and say, 'This is what we are.' "Salas' group and other local immigrant rights advocates, unions and legalorganizations sent a letter last week to Garcetti and other elected officialscalling for more aggressive action in the face of possible deportations.The letter didn't single out politicians but warned that "abstract statementsand vague promises will not be enough to confront the threat we now face."Among other things, the groups want city and county funding for legalrepresentation for immigrants in deportation proceedings, and strongerassurances the Sheriff's Department and Los Angeles Police Department won't workwith Immigration and Customs Enforcement to crack down on immigrants.While praising Garcetti's work in helping immigrants, Betty Hung, policydirector for Asian Americans Advancing Justice-LA, said in a statement that themayor should "rise to the challenge of demonstrating strong and bold leadershipto show unequivocally -- in concrete policies and actions -- that Los Angeleswill hold the line."Garcetti's office didn't respond to a request for comment about the letter, andthe mayor declined to be interviewed for this story.In public statements, he frequently puts the battle over immigration in economicterms, saying mass deportations would hurt the Southern California economy, andthat the region depends on the labor and tax dollars of non-citizens.He also mentions his own immigrant family, including his grandfather who wasbrought from Mexico as a baby.Garcetti brought up immigration in his call with Trump, stressing the importantrole immigrants play in L.A.'s economy and the need for immigration reform,according to a statement released by the mayor's office.The statement did not indicate what, if anything, Trump said about immigration,though it did highlight his support for L.A.'s Olympic bid.As Garcetti seeks to forge working ties with someone he not so long ago deridedas "the ultimate caricature of a politician," some are waiting to see if themore measured approach pays off.Said Wilke of the League of United Latin American Citizens: "If Garcetti thinkshe has a shot with Donald Trump, let's just let that play out."--dakota.smith@latimes.com
