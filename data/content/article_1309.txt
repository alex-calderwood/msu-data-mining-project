Romney pal sees Trump and potential State pick balancing each other outShortly after Donald Trump won the presidential election, one of Mitt Romney'sclosest friends sent him an urgent plea over email: Move past the campaignhostility and, for the "best interests of the country," consider joining the newpresident's team as his secretary of state.Then the friend, Stephen Pagliuca, who worked with Romney at Bain Capital andhas socialized with Trump, urged advisers to the president-elect to press Trumpto name Romney for the State Department job.Pagliuca's messages, which he sent shortly after he saw that Romney's name wasbeing floated, are part of the behind-the-scenes effort to heal a seeminglyunbridgeable divide between two bitter foes, one a beloved figure of theRepublican establishment and the other who upended his party hierarchy and wonthe White House as an avowed outsider.During the campaign, Romney called Trump a "phony" and a "fraud," and Trump saidRomney was a "choker" who walked "like a penguin."But Pagliuca, a co-owner of the Boston Celtics and a Democrat, said he knewsomething that others didn't. When he golfed with Trump at a Boston-area coursesome years ago, Trump had talked at length about how much he admired BainCapital, a private equity firm that Romney led until 1999.Today, as Pagliuca and other Romney backers see it, Trump, 70, and the69-year-old Romney had far more in common than many realize: Both came toprominence as risk takers and dealmakers, and both have spent much of theirlives seeking to emulate and outdo the success of their famous fathers. Trump'sfather, Fred, was a New York City developer, and Romney's father, George, was agovernor of Michigan who unsuccessfully sought the presidency.This shared background may not be enough to persuade Trump to nominate Romney tobe his secretary of state.Nevertheless, Trump has made clear that Romney is a candidate for the job, andthe two met Tuesday night for nearly two hours over dinner at Jean-Georgesrestaurant in New York, accompanied by the Republican National Committeechairman, Reince Priebus, who is slated to be White House chief of staff.Speaking to reporters, Romney sounded nothing like the man who earlier this yeardeclared Trump a fraud, remarking instead that he was deeply impressed with thepresident-elect. He did not apologize for his earlier criticism.Romney said that his conversation with Trump was "enlightening and interestingand engaging" and that he had been "very impressed" by Trump's victory speech,which called for inclusion.The former Massachusetts governor said he has been impressed by Trump'stransition operation and by the people selected for other Cabinet posts. Romneysaid that all of those factors "give me increasing hope that President-electTrump is the very man who can lead us to" a bright future.Trump's consideration of the 2012 Republican presidential nominee has drawnoutrage from some, but advocates argue that Romney's background and intellectwould provide a crucial balance for the foreign policy team."I think Trump sees that," Pagliuca said.Romney, meanwhile, sees the possible job not just as a way to fulfill his desireto serve, but also to salve deep wounds, having lost both the race for theRepublican presidential nomination in 2008 and the 2012 general electioncampaign for president."Romney's motivation, I suspect, is that losing twice still stings, so achievinga prominent position like secretary of state would wash away some of thebitterness of losing two presidential elections," said Rob Gray, who served as akey adviser during Romney's Massachusetts gubernatorial campaign andgovernorship.A Trump spokesman did not respond to a request for comment.Romney associates said they see him as a person who would make up for Trump'sdeficiencies."I would describe a potential relationship as complementary," said Marc Wolpow,who worked with Romney at Bain Capital from 1990 to 1999 and also has met Trump."I think if you would merge both of them you'd have the perfect president ...Mitt could be the good cop to the bad cops that surround Trump."Wolpow said the two men probably see qualities in the other that each ismissing. Romney, he said, failed to connect with blue-collar voters and made"excuses" for his wealth, but he possesses the diplomatic skills to be secretaryof state. Trump hit it off with many average voters and cited his financialfortune as part of his appeal, but his brusque manner could be problematic inhandling world affairs."Mitt has the brilliance, the analytical mind, the temperament," Wolpow said. "Ithink Trump sees in Mitt ... qualities that Trump doesn't have, and I think Mittsees in Trump qualities that Mitt doesn't have."Associates said Romney's Mormon faith also plays a role. Although they saidRomney would not try to use the position of secretary of state to directlyinfluence people to consider converting to his religion, the job would be one ofthe highest-profile government positions ever held by a Mormon, which could helpthe church's effort to gain acceptance around the world.Trump, for his part, has a history of working with Mormons and has said hevalues their work ethic. Trump once counted as his closest friend and businessassociate a Mormon named Stephen Hyde, who oversaw Trump's Atlantic City casinoempire until he died in a 1989 helicopter crash. Trump, in an interview with TheWashington Post earlier this year, said he admired the way Hyde devoted himselfto his work and his church, recalling that the company deducted Hyde's tithingdirectly from his paycheck."Every month he would give a big percentage of his salary to the Mormon church,which I always respected a lot," Trump said.Romney's moralistic sense of responsibility couldn't be more different fromTrump's self-styled playboy lifestyle, which has included two divorces and ahigh-profile affair. But Trump and Romney share a trait that is important toboth men: Trump, whose brother died of symptoms related to alcoholism, andRomney share an aversion to alcohol; both men have said they never drink.Romney, like Trump, does not have deep experience in foreign affairs. He servedas a Mormon missionary in France, did some deals around the world and oversawthe 2002 Salt Lake City Olympics. During the 2012 campaign, he relied heavily ona bevy of foreign policy and military advisers, not always successfully. Duringa visit, he stunned British organizers of the Olympics by saying their effortsat security were "disconcerting." The Guardian headlined a story about hisvisit, "Mitt Romney visits London while stumbling on almost every front."Romney famously labeled Russia as the No. 1 geopolitical foe of the UnitedStates, a view mocked by some at the time but later seen as prescient, givenRussia's annexation of Crimea and other actions. Trump has taken a rosier view,signaling that he wants to reset Russian relations.Romney, whose father was born in Mexico - where the family had moved to escapeanti-polygamy laws in the United States - has urged closer ties between theUnited States and its southern neighbor. Trump has promised to build a wallbetween the nations and make Mexico pay for it, and he proposed banning mostMuslims from entering the country. That prompted Romney earlier this year to sayTrump "creates scapegoats of Muslims and Mexican immigrants."The two agree, however, on many other foreign policy issues, such as moving theU.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, a top priority for Trump. Romney said in2012 that he would declare China a currency manipulator on his first day inoffice, a pledge duplicated by Trump. When Trump endorsed Romney in 2012, Romneysaid he was "very pleased" because Trump "shares my concern about China - thefact that China has been able to run roughshod over many industries in thiscountry. Presidents have complained about it, but really haven't taken action tostop China from taking away our jobs."Trump initially mocked Romney's plan to have 11 million illegal immigrants"self-deport," calling it "crazy" and "maniacal," warning that it would causethe Republican Party to lose many Hispanic supporters. But Trump eventuallyone-upped Romney on his proposal, calling for forced deportation and saying someMexican immigrants were criminals and "rapists" and "some, I assume, are goodpeople."As for Trump's assertion that Romney walked like a penguin, the president-electrecently looked at Romney and saw a different visage. He said Romney, who isinvariably formal, well-coifed and finely dressed, "looks the part" of secretaryof state.michael.kranish@washpost.com
