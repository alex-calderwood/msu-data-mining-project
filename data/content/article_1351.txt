Yucca Mountain is back on the bargaining table on Capitol Hill.And if the nuclear waste repository in Nevada gets back on track -- and that's abig "if," considering the controversial site has been debated for going on 40years and six presidential administrations -- it could provide a destination forthe 3.6 million pounds of nuclear waste now beached at the San Onofre NuclearGenerating Station."There will almost certainly be efforts to reintroduce legislation that wouldrestart the Yucca process," said David Victor, chairman of the CommunityEngagement Panel, which acts as a liaison between the public and the operatorsat San Onofre."What's interesting is this is not a normal left-right [political] issue."Located about 100 miles northwest of Las Vegas, Yucca Mountain at one time wasdetermined to be the best site to deposit the nation's nuclear waste, which hasnow reached more than 70,000 metric tons at some 120 sites across the country.The site was slated to open in 2017. But Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nev.), who loathedthe idea of storing waste in his home state, became the Senate majority leaderafter the 2006 elections.During the 2008 presidential campaign, then-Sen. Barack Obama said YuccaMountain was "an expensive failure and should be abandoned." The Obamaadministration cut off funding for Yucca Mountain in 2010.The January retirement of Reid from the Senate and the arrival of theadministration of President-elect Donald Trump has led to speculation that YuccaMountain -- which has already cost taxpayers $9 billion to $15 billion -- couldbe revived and re-funded.Trump has not taken a position on Yucca Mountain, but last month during acampaign stop in Nevada, he said he was "going to take a look at it."A report from Bloomberg News last week cited two unidentified people familiarwith Trump's transition planning who said reopening Yucca Mountain is "beingactively discussed by advisors."Rep. John Shimkus (R-Ill.), considered to be in line to become chairman of theHouse Energy and Commerce Committee, has long maintained that Yucca Mountainrepresents "the fastest, best and most viable solution" for storing waste.Should the Yucca Mountain debate return to the halls of Congress, Victor saidits best chance for survival would come if it is combined with another potentialnuclear waste solution: consolidated interim storage.Under consolidated storage, sites would be built in isolated locations like thedesert where multiple plants could deposit their waste.Democrats and Republicans -- many of them anxious to get waste shipped out oftheir home states -- have introduced legislation to help clear the way forconsolidated storage.One site in West Texas and another in eastern New Mexico have been mentioned aspotential destinations for San Onofre's waste and could open as early as the2020s -- a short time period by nuclear waste timetables -- if they can clear aseries of daunting political and regulatory hurdles."I think you can get a bigger coalition by linking Yucca to consolidatedstorage," said Victor, who is also a professor of international relations at UCSan Diego.Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) echoed those remarks last week."We have tried year after year to get a pilot waste" program, Feinstein said ata Senate subcommittee hearing. "We know there are people who want to build it, awaste facility, because even if Yucca went ahead, Yucca would be filled."Feinstein has co-sponsored nuclear waste legislation with two Republicans andanother Senate Democrat.Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Vista) also has co-sponsored a bill to find alternativesites for nuclear waste. The San Onofre nuclear plant is in Issa's congressionaldistrict."Obviously we would love it if we had a permanent site, especially one that hadso much time and money spent on it," Issa said."But if Congress reopens the question, we shouldn't open it with a prejudicethat it must be good. And we shouldn't allow the prejudice that Harry Reidalways had that it must be bad. The in-between is putting together the properbalance of pros and cons and have it fairly and scientifically reevaluated."The issue is of particular importance to California, where more than 3,000 tonsof spent nuclear fuel is stranded.Victor was quick to point out that efforts to reach a political solution onYucca Mountain could end up on the back burner as other policies promoted by theRepublican-controlled House of Representatives and Senate take center stage."There are going to be other things that are going to be much higher on theirlist -- Obamacare, for one," Victor said. "Those are going to be verycomplicated issues that could really suck the oxygen out of the legislativeprocess."And Victor noted that even if a deal on nuclear waste is reached on CapitolHill, there is still a regulatory process to be navigated."Congress can't legislate Yucca to open," Victor said. "Congress can restart theprocess of Yucca going through all the regulatory approvals, which it is nearlydone with, but not completely. That does not insulate Yucca from all sorts oflocal problems and possible changes in administrations in the future."--rob.nikolewski@sduniontribune.com
