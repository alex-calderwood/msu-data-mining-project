LIMA, Peru - Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg urged world leaders meeting in Peru onSaturday to help get more people online to improve global living standards whileseparately announcing new measures to cut down on fake news stories on thesocial network that some suggest could have helped sway the U.S. presidentialelection.The Facebook founder took on the role of an evangelist for "connectivity" as hespoke at an Asian-Pacific trade summit, lamenting that half the world has noaccess to the online world. He urged leaders at the Asia-Pacific EconomicCooperation Forum to work with his company and others to close that gap.But as he was promoting the benefits of the online world in the speech, he tookto his Facebook page to address one of the downsides of the internet: the rapiddissemination of bogus news stories on social networks.Zuckerberg said in a post late Friday that his company was taking measures tocurb what he said was a "relatively small" percentage of deliberately falsestories. The measures include developing new tools to detect and classify"misinformation" and to make it easier for users to report the material.He said the company also is looking into the possibility of working withestablished fact-checking organizations to evaluate content and into thefeasibility of warning labels for stories flagged as false.Critics have complained that a surge of fake news stories on Facebook may haveswayed some voters to back President-elect Donald Trump. The company said onMonday that it was clarifying its advertising policy to emphasize that it won'tdisplay ads - thus cutting revenue - for sites that run information that is"illegal, misleading or deceptive, which includes fake news.""The bottom line is: we take misinformation seriously," the Facebook CEO said inhis post.Zuckerberg's comments came after President Barack Obama, who is also attendingthe APEC summit, and others have been sharply critical of the spread of fakenews online.
