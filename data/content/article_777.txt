WASHINGTON - Sen. Elizabeth Warren delivered a ferocious attack Monday oncongressional Republicans and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell over amedical research bill, and put fellow Democrats on the spot by pushing them tooppose a measure she said "is corrupt, and it is very, very dangerous."As Congress began the final stretch of its post-election session, Warren saidthe 996-page measure - a top priority for GOP leaders and backed by thebiomedical industry - was riddled with provisions that she called "a bunch ofspecial giveaways" to big pharmaceutical companies."They didn't send us here to whimper, whine or grovel," she said on the Senatefloor about Democrats, using the populist rhetoric that has given her one of herparty's highest profiles. "They sent us here to say no to efforts to sellCongress to the highest bidder."Warren, D-Mass., said voters are "hoping we show some spine and start fightingback when Congress completely ignores the message of the American people."She said the research bill would "legalize fraud by reducing the scientificevidence the government needs to approve existing drugs for new uses. She saidit would "cover up bribery by exempting medical companies from publiclyreporting some payments they make to doctors.Those provisions, she said, outweighed the "tiny fig leaf of additional moneythe bill provides for biomedical research and combating abuse of addictiveopioid drugs."I cannot vote for this bill. I will fight it because I know the differencebetween compromise and extortion, said Warren, who some mention as a potential2020 presidential contender.Warren's comments came with Democrats in the early stages of decoding theirlesson from this month's elections. Hillary Clinton shockingly lost her WhiteHouse bid to Republican Donald Trump and Democrats remained in the House andSenate minority, making only small gains in each chamber.Warren is expected to try tugging her party toward more progressive policies,while some more moderate Democrats are emphasizing the need to appeal to thetype of working-class white voters who helped Trump win Midwestern statescarried in recent elections by Democrats.The House plans to vote on the research legislation Wednesday, with Senateconsideration expected next week.The measure calls for spending $6.3 billion over the next decade, including $4.8billion for research at the National Institutes of Health. There is also $1billion for grants to states for drug abuse prevention and research, and $500million for the Food and Drug Administration to accelerate drug and medicaldevice approval processes.Warren said the bill benefits a Republican donor who backs contentious therapiesthat are supposed to regenerate cells. She did not name the donor during herspeech but said McConnell, R-Ky., has accepted contributions from him.A McConnell spokesman declined to comment.No. 2 Senate GOP leader John Cornyn of Texas, on the Senate floor as Warrenspoke, criticized her for making "a political speech and launching "personalattacks on senators and called her comments "beneath the dignity of the UnitedStates Senate.McConnell said this month that the overall bill is a major priority forCongress' lame-duck session and singled out its provisions helping regenerativemedicine.A Warren spokesman said later that Warren was referring to an April report byPolitico that said separate legislation helping companies get approval forstem-cell treatments was backed by Ed Bosarge, a wealthy Texan. The report saidBosarge has donated to McConnell's political committee and invested inregenerative medicine.Top Republicans announced the mammoth research bill last week, more than a yearafter the House by an overwhelmingly bipartisan margin approved an earlierversion.Most Democrats have not said whether they support the measure, though othersalso are expected to object to it.One of the few public objections Monday came from Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa,chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. He said he wanted the removal of theprovision letting companies not report some payments to doctors, which consumergroups have complained encourage doctors to prescribe those companies' products.
