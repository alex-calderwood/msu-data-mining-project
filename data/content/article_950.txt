While most were watching the presidential election results come in two weeksago, Rosalinda Espinosa had more pressing concerns."On Election Day, I wasfocused on my chemistry test," said Espinosa, a freshman at the University ofOklahoma who is studying engineering. "I just did not think it was possible forDonald Trump to win."But as Trump reached the number of electoral votes toclinch the presidency, Espinosa said she and other classmates who areundocumented residents panicked, cried and wondered what their future wouldhold.Trump had launched his campaign on a promise to deport millions ofundocumented residents and is now two months away from becoming president. Theanxieties and fears of many Hispanic families in the community have reached anapex as they wait for policy details to emerge from the president-elect."Livingin Oklahoma, you get tornadoes and as a kid you are scared of these tornadoesbecause you don't know what is going to happen," said Espinosa, who was broughtto Oklahoma from Mexico by her parents when she was just a few months old."That's the exact same feeling I got when the election results came in.I feel like a tornado is coming and I don't know what to do."Along with ageneral concern over what an increase in deportation efforts might look likeunder a Trump administration, undocumented young adults are worried about theremoval of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), an executive orderunder President Barack Obama that has offered a path to employment and collegefor students who were brought to the United States at a young age.OklahomaCity's emerging Hispanic community is largely made up of United States citizens- just 37 percent of the city's roughly 125,000 Hispanic residents are foreignborn, according to Pew Research.Even the designation of being born outside thecountry does not necessarily mean a person is not a U.S. citizen or unauthorizedto be in the country.But there are thousands in the community who lack properdocumentation as Oklahoma City has grown as a destination for many from Mexico,El Salvador, Guatemala and other Latin American countries seeking a betterlife."We get to work and go to school in the United States legally, which issomething our parents can't do," said Samanta De La Rosa, an undocumentedresident from Oklahoma City now attending OU. "We are out of the shadows, butour fear is we will have to go back into the shadows."Post electionIn the earlymonths of his campaign, Trump spoke of deporting all undocumented immigrants.But since his election he has taken a softer stance, saying his initial focuswill be on deporting violent criminals and taking a wait-and-see attitude on therest."Because of some of the backtracking from Trump since the election, it doesgive me some hope," said Robert Ruiz, executive director of ScissortailCommunity Development Corporation, a nonprofit that works in the Hispaniccommunity. "But that may just be a huge amount of optimism on my part."AspiringAmericans is a Scissortail program that assists undocumented residents inobtaining legal status to study and work, which includes applying for DACA."Wehave been encouraging students to stop applying because we are not even sure theprogram will remain," said Tracey Medina, program director of AspiringAmericans, referring to Trump's campaign promise to end DACA.Medina said DACAapplications are expensive and it's not worth the risk applying until moredetails come from the new administration.There is also a fear among some thatapplying gives the federal government personal information that could be used ina future deportation effort."If they were looking for people to deport, thiswould give the federal government a place to start," said Terry Hartle, seniorvice president of the American Council on Education's Division of Government andPublic Affairs, speaking last week at a forum hosted by the Education WritersAssociation in Washington. "We will have to wait and see what the governmentdecides to do with that database."Many local undocumented students said theyhave been advised not the leave the country after Jan. 20 - Trump's inauguration- for fear of not being allowed to re-enter the United States. This has put injeopardy plans to study abroad or visit family."It would mean a lot of changesin my life, like no job and no access to scholarships to continue my education,"said Heily Maldonado, a chemical engineering major at OU who has DACA relief. "Iremember when I was younger I was afraid of everything because of my status â?¦and losing DACA would mean going back to that."Future applicantsEven if thosealready enrolled in college might be able to continue, there is a fear aboutwhether siblings will have the same chance."My little sister who is a junior inhigh school might not be able to get the same opportunity I received to go intohigher education and that's a big deal," said Carlos Rubio Regalado, an OUstudent. "That's why our parents are here. It's for that education."Espinosasaid good grades, lots of volunteer hours and a high ACT score had her on trackfor college until she learned during her senior year in high school that herundocumented status would prevent her from receiving government-backed studentaid.But DACA opened the door to college and she began her freshman year at OUlast fall."DACA has definitely offered opportunity and hope," Espinosa said."But since the election, whenever I see my undocumented classmates they look soempty and not there."The risk of DACA's removal also has some soon-to-be collegegraduates worried about their prospects for employment."One of our biggestconcerns is students who will be graduating in December or January who alreadyhave job offers, but if DACA is taken away they will not be able to take thosejobs," Medina said.Until Trump announces further details about what hisadministration will do concerning undocumented residents and programs that offerassistance, many said there was nothing to do but wait."It would be better toknow my doom instead of living in this uncertainty," Espinosa said. "I have noclue what I can do right now."
