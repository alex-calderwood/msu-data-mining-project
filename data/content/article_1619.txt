There is now credible information regarding the election results. Evidence ofcybercorruption involving Pennsylvania, Ohio and Wisconsin is substantial. Thiswould throw the results of the 2016 presidential election into dispute.I understand that to contest the results of the presidential election wouldbring this country into a state of chaos, and normally I would see this as worsethan the conflict we are trying to resolve. But in this case it is not. Thestakes are too high. We have recent history in the George W. Bush era that whenthe questionable election was not disputed, in both 2000 and 2004 elections,disaster ensued.I implore Hillary Clinton to fight. Fight for this country, for our future, forthe environment, for our children.
