Last week, Fox News' Sean Hannity spoke out against those exercising theirconstitutional right to protest Donald Trump's impending presidency, tellingthem to "grow up" and that they need to "get over themselves." Authors ofseveral letters to the Daily Camera have expressed similar opinions and havepointed out that none of these types of protests took place when President Obamawas first elected. Perhaps those opposed to Obama felt their voices would gounheeded -- an unfortunate miscalculation of the importance of peaceful dissent-- though maybe they just didn't care or were simply complacent.But let's be clear: there's a very good reason why so many people are speakingout so soon against President-elect Trump. He has been the most divisivepresidential candidate, and now president-elect, in at least the last 60 years,making statements and promises that have many minority groups and one majoritygroup (women) truly fearing for their standing and well-being as Americancitizens, not to mention his complete lack of decency as a private citizen. Inthe words of Thomas L. Friedman, "We can never be great as a country with apresident with the warped values of Donald Trump." The ultimate irony is that it is Republicans -- Trump's very own party -- whofancy themselves the chief defenders of the Constitution, yet it is these samepeople who feel compelled to criticize citizens who are actually practicing itsmost sacred of principles, one that our president-elect would seem  happy todispense with. The protestors need to keep the pressure on until he absolutelyproves that he is not the repulsive man that he himself has defined over thelast 50 years, often with disdain for many of those he now represents, includingsome who even voted for him.
