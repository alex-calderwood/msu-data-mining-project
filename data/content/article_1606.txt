For now.Roberts and the rest of the Supreme Court probably will be called on to reviewTrump's major undertakings as president. Trump could need Roberts' vote onmatters ranging from immigration to health care to environmental regulations.Will it matter that in the course of the campaign, Trump had harsh words for theleader of the federal judiciary? The pointed criticism of a justice by name wasonly one in a long list of unusual aspects of Trump's campaign for thepresidency."Justice Roberts really let us down," Trump told an audience in Aiken, SouthCarolina, last December. "What he did with Obamacare was disgraceful, and Ithink he did that because he wanted to be popular inside the Beltway," he added,referring to greater Washington.A month later, in an interview with ABC News' George Stephanopoulos, Trump againreferred to the health care decisions when he said, "Justice Roberts turned outto be an absolute disaster."Roberts was savaged by several Republican presidential candidates, an unusualspectacle given Roberts' appointment by a Republican president and his generallyconservative record. Roberts has not responded to the criticism. Among thejustices, Ruth Bader Ginsburg made plain her dislike of Trump in July, thenwalked back her comments a few days later.
