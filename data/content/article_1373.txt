President-elect Donald Trump's postelection victory party has veered into adizzying paradox.Rather than celebrating, he is amplifying far-right conspiracies to underminethe credibility of an election he won. At the same time, he is finding somecommon cause in the quixotic effort by the fringe left to prevent him fromreaching the White House.The chances of changing the election result with selective ballot recounts, assome on the left hope, or finding widespread voter fraud as alleged by Trump arenext to nil. Yet a combination of self-interest and a desire for misdirectionhave propelled factions of both parties to debate the results of an electionalready decisively settled.Trump's motives are often hard to pinpoint. But by pushing the myth thatmillions of ballots were cast illegally for his opponent, as he has done onTwitter in recent days, he may be building the case to claim a larger mandatefor his victory despite the fact that Hillary Clinton is leading the popularvote by more than 2 million votes.The issue also distracts attention from mounting questions about the financialconflicts of interest he is likely to have in the White House, given that heplans to allow his children to run his international real estate and brandingbusiness while he serves as president. Finally, Trump's rhetoric may also sowthe seeds of future efforts to propose more restrictive voting rules championedby some of his top advisors.At the other end of the ideological spectrum, failed Green Party candidate JillStein has been seeking voter recounts in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania,three states that Trump won and that together carry enough electoral votes togive the election to Clinton. Reversing the result in just one of the states,let alone all three, is all but impossible. Yet Stein's gambit allows her toraise money and attract attention to a candidacy that failed to galvanize thevast majority of voters."I've never seen this kind of attack on poll workers and how the system works,"said Mark Thomsen, a Democratic appointee who is chairman of the ElectionsCommission in Wisconsin, the first state in which Stein sought a recount. "We'regoing to play it out, and I'm confident that the president-elect is going towin. We're doing everything we can so that it's timely and that it doesn'timpact the electoral college."Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, a Republican, tweeted that the expense -- $3.5million in his state -- was "hard to justify" given that Trump's margin ofvictory was four times that of the closest presidential election in Wisconsin.It was also 17 times the largest revised margin resulting from any recount inthe last 16 years.Wisconsin was set to begin recounting nearly 3 million ballots Thursday if Steinand another minor-party candidate who also petitioned for it came up with themoney to pay for it by Tuesday afternoon. The expense is due in part to hiringthousands of temporary workers needed to meet a federal deadline of Dec. 13 tocomplete the tallies. Stein said she had raised $6.5 million.The two other states could follow, though Stein may lack the organization tofinish the job. On Monday, she announced she had been successful in initiatingrecounts in only 100 of more than 9,000 Pennsylvania precincts. She needs votersfrom each precinct to contest results on her behalf.Trump leads by 22,177 votes in Wisconsin, according to the last county-by-countyfigures released by the state Elections Commission. The president-elect alsoleads by 68,030 votes in Pennsylvania and 10,704 in Michigan, which certifiedits results Monday.Statewide ballot recounts are rare, and examples of swinging the outcome ofelections are even rarer. Just 27 statewide elections were subject to recountsfrom 2000 to 2015, according to an analysis from the nonprofit group FairVote,reported by FiveThirtyEight, with an average of 282 votes shifting as a result.Only three candidates won elections because of recounts, according to theanalysis."I've never seen a recount overturn margins as large as the ones we're dealingwith here," said David Wasserman, an elections analyst for the nonpartisan CookPolitical Report who is closely monitoring the state-by-state electoral tallies.Clinton's campaign, even as it agrees with that assessment, has made the awkwarddecision to participate, albeit minimally, in the recount. Her campaign did itsown due diligence in Wisconsin and other states and found no "actionableevidence" of vote manipulation that would merit challenging, and saw littlechance that a recount would overturn the election result, according to campaignattorney Marc Elias. But in light of Stein's efforts, the Clinton campaign saidit was important, "on principle, to ensure our campaign is legally represented"in any recount proceedings.Trump, though he criticized Stein, echoed her distrust in the system, which hecalled rigged throughout the election. On Twitter, he made a baseless claim of"serious voter fraud" in three states he lost -- Virginia, New Hampshire andCalifornia -- and asserted without evidence that he would have "won the popularvote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally."California, where Clinton is ahead by more than 3 million votes as ballotscontinue being counted, has safeguards built into its voting system, includingautomatic recounts in close races. California Secretary of State Alex Padilla, aDemocrat, noted that Trump's claim of fraud in the state was unsubstantiated andcalled it absurd."His reckless tweets are inappropriate and unbecoming of a president-elect,"Padilla said in a statement.Trump's spokesman, Jason Miller, on Monday referred to Stein's "recountnonsense" while talking up Trump's "mandate to push forward" on his agenda. Hedecried the media for "chasing the shiny object of the Jill Stein recounteffort."Yet he defended Trump's accusations of widespread voter fraud elsewhere, citingstudies that point to clerical errors on the voter rolls -- but no evidence offraud -- and to a discredited report suggesting noncitizens had voted in the2008 election.The last time that Wisconsin, whose Elections Commission met Monday to reviewrecount procedures, had a statewide recount was in a state Supreme Court race in2011. In an election with just more than half as many ballots cast as in thismonth's election, it cost $520,000, according to an Associated Press survey ofcounty clerks.Wisconsin has no threshold for triggering an automatic recount, leaving it up tocandidates to request, and pay for, any re-tallying of the votes. Candidatesmust also state a reason for seeking the recount -- evidence of fraud orirregularities, for instance.On Friday, just ahead of a deadline, Stein submitted her request to theElections Commission, leveling accusations of foreign tampering."After a presidential election tarnished by the use of outdated and unreliablemachines and accusations of irregularities and hacks, people of all politicalpersuasions are asking if our election results are reliable," Stein said in astatement Monday.Wisconsin election officials on Monday repeatedly expressed doubt about whethera recount would reverse Trump's victory in the state, while challenging Stein'sclaims of irregularities resulting from a potential hack.Though different counties use different voting machines, none are ever online.State law requires rigorous security measures for all machines, includingtesting 10 days before the election. Tampering with them would require"unfettered physical access to voting equipment," said Michael Haas, theElections Commission administrator.The commission says its elections administration is the most decentralized inthe country, primarily run at the county level with state supervision, anotherhurdle for anyone trying to perpetuate widespread voter fraud."It's most unfortunate that the president-elect is claiming that there's hugeproblems with our system and it's feeding what I'll call the conspiracy theory,"said Thomsen, the commission chairman. "I'd like him to come down out of hisTrump Tower ... and spend time with the folks on the ground who are countingthese votes."--noah.bierman@latimes.comTwitter: @noahbiermanmichael.memoli@latimes.comTwitter: @mikememoli
