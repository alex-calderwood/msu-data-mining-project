So much for respecting the political process. Remember, that's what bothPresident Obama and Hillary Clinton urged after she lost the presidentialelection. The peaceful transfer of power is a hallmark of our democracy, and allAmericans -- no matter how they voted -- should support this cornerstone of ourrepublic.Apparently, that's fine in theory but not in practice.Donald Trump soon will be sworn in as our 45th president. He accomplished thisby carrying 30 states and accumulating 306 electoral votes.So why should a major Massachusetts employer feel the need to apologize becauseit agrees with a policy the president-elect also endorses?By the way, socialist firebrand Bernie Sanders sides with Trump on this one --as does Clinton, after flip-flopping during the presidential campaign.So apparently, it's the who -- not the what -- that counts. Even if that who isthe president of the United States.That's the incredible situation in which sneaker maker New Balance finds itself,just because one of its officers stated the obvious.Responding to a question by a Wall Street Journal reporter about the pendingObama-backed Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement, New Balance's vicepresident of public affairs stated essentially that its business prospectsshould improve with President Trump's policies in place.That's because Trump -- plus Sanders, Clinton and many in Congress of bothparties -- see the TPP as a domestic jobs killer. New Balance, which operatesfive factories in this country, including one in Lawrence, wants to protectthose jobs from unfair foreign competition, which it believes the TPP willfacilitate.As a result, New Balance received tons of social media outrage and boycottthreats, for suggesting that Trump might know something about business.And now it's receiving advice on how to essentially apologize for daring to usethe name of the next president of the United States in a positive light.Would there have been any indignation if that New Balance executive hadmentioned a president-elect Clinton in the same response? Of course not.It's not the position; it's the person.We're sorry New Balance has fallen victim to this toxic post-electionenvironment, especially since the company represents an industry struggling tostay alive in this state and country.We'd hope members of our congressional delegation would stick up for New Balanceand the high-paying jobs it represents, but as we've already observed, nonedares take the political risk of alienating the Democratic base.And so we advise New Balance's employees to take notice of those who didn't cometo your company's defense in this time of crisis.
