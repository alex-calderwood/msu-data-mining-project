BOSTON -- It didn't take a divisive presidential election to get Mark Chesterinterested in immigrants. Chester has been celebrating immigrants for years,making it his mission to photograph two people from every nation.Chester is well on his way. Since 2011, he's photographed people from 185 of theworld's 196 countries, all of them immigrants who have settled in Massachusetts,a state he affectionately calls "a mini United Nations." All his subjects havebecome naturalized U.S. citizens.Chester's collection of more than 350 photographs have been exhibited aroundMassachusetts -- most recently at the Statehouse -- and he is now putting theminto a book he plans to distribute free to schools and libraries around thestate.He said his project, called "The Bay State: A Multicultural Landscape --Photographs of New Americans," has taken on new meaning since RepublicanPresident-elect Donald Trump said during his campaign he would build a wallalong the U.S. border with Mexico and temporarily ban Muslims from entering theU.S."It seems like it's more important to bring attention to this now," he said,adding that "people from other countries are living here, they're Americans. Thepurpose of this is to educate, to enlighten, to make people aware of people fromdifferent countries."SEE photos,  A8"This wasn't intended to be any kind of geopolitical statement when I firststarted this," he said.Chester's photos offer a glimpse into the lives of immigrants who have embracedtheir new country but retained some of the culture of their homelands.There is 92-year-old Maria Dias, leaning on her cane in front of a beach shackin Truro, on the tip of Cape Cod, dressed in a traditional embroidered shawl andapron of her native Portugal.Haseeb Hosein, originally from Trinidad and Tobago and now a Boston policedistrict commander, is shown smiling in front of his office, dressed in hispolice blues.Olga Kwasniewski, a native of the former Soviet republic of Uzbekistan, is shownstanding in front of Boston Harbor, wearing a sash celebrating her win in a 2013beauty pageant.Kwasniewski, who is now a restaurant owner and model, said she agreed to bephotographed by Chester because she thinks it's important to celebrate thecontributions immigrants make to America and the gratitude they feel to be U.S.citizens."The way he is picturing people at their workplace or their home, that shows howthey are still bringing part of their country to American life, and how theirlives have changed here," she said.Chester, 71, a professional photographer who lives on Cape Cod, is applying forcultural grants, looking for corporate sponsors and raising private money topublish his book. To find subjects from countries around the world, he attendsnaturalization ceremonies, goes to ethnic restaurants and has even been known toask cab drivers where they're from.He's still searching for people from 11 countries, including Comoros, anarchipelago off Africa's East Coast; Tonga, a Polynesian kingdom of SouthPacific Islands; and Liechtenstein, a German-speaking principality betweenAustria and Switzerland.One of the project's sponsors is the Massachusetts Immigrant and RefugeeAdvocacy Coalition. Sue Parsons, MIRA's development coordinator, said Chester'sphotos capture the sense of optimism many immigrants have after they settlehere."Each photo shows their energy, and their hopefulness shines through," Parsonssaid.From Page A1Photographer Mark Chester stands for a portrait next to images in his exhibitcalled "The Bay State: A Multicultural Landscape -- Photographs of NewAmericans" at the Statehouse in Boston.
