WASHINGTON - Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen said she has no plans to stepdown before her term ends, reiterated the Fed's political independence anddefended tougher bank regulations established in the wake of the financialcrisis in remarks Thursday to Congress.Her remarks suggest that the central bank is on track to raise interest rates atits meeting in December, one month before President-elect Donald Trump takesoffice.An improving U.S. economy has bolstered the case for raising interest rates,Yellen told Congress' Joint Economic Committee. Economic data since Fedpolicymakers gathered in early November reinforced her view that the economy ismaking progress toward the Fed's goals on employment and inflation.She said that at the meeting, she and her colleagues believed that the case fora rate increase "had continued to strengthen and that such an increase couldwell become appropriate relatively soon."Analysts viewed Yellen's comments as an effort to put markets on notice that arate hike is likely to occur at the Fed's last meeting of the year on Dec.13-14. They noted that she dismissed a suggestion that increased marketuncertainty after Trump's election might be cause for a delay.Asked whether it might be better to push back a move until January, Yellen saidthat uncertainty surrounding Trump's proposals for tax cuts and infrastructurespending could last longer than one month."Yellen's testimony before Congress ... further cemented in place expectationsthat the Fed will hike rates next month," said Michael Feroli, senior economistat JPMorgan.Asked about her own future, Yellen said it was "fully my intention" to remain asFed chair until her four-year term ends in late January 2018.The Fed raised its key interest rate in December 2015 and projected that itcould raise rates as many as four times in 2016. But it deferred as the U.S.economy went through a prolonged soft patch. The rate has remained in a range of0.25 percent to 0.5 percent for the entire year. The rate had been at a recordlow near zero for seven years.Economists are forecasting that the Fed will raise rates by a quarter-point inDecember and then will boost rates twice in 2017.In addition to firmly stating that she has no plans of leaving the Fed beforeher term as chair is complete, Yellen also made clear that her views on bankregulation differ from Trump's.Yellen gave a strong defense of the Dodd-Frank Act, passed by Congress in 2010to increase financial market regulations in an effort to prevent a repeat of the2008 financial crisis. After the country lived through a "devastating financialcrisis," Yellen said that "I would not want to see the clock turned back on allthe improvements we have made."
