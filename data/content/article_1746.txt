Truth is dead. Facts are passe.And the emoji is so last year.Oxford Dictionaries has selected "post-truth" as 2016's international word ofthe year, after the contentious "Brexit" referendum and an equally divisive U.S.presidential election caused usage of the adjective to skyrocket, according tothe Oxford University Press.Each year, the Oxford staff selects hundreds of words, then narrows that listdown through discussions about what words are going to best highlight the waysin which the English lexicon is changing in response to current events.The dictionary defines "post-truth" as "relating to or denoting circumstances inwhich objective facts are less influential in shaping public opinion thanappeals to emotion and personal belief."In this case, the "post-" prefix doesn't mean "after" so much as it implies anatmosphere in which a notion is irrelevant - but then again, who says you haveto take our word for it anymore?Throughout a grueling presidential campaign in which accusations of lies andalternate realities flowed freely, in every direction, hundreds of fact checkswere published about statements from both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.Dozens of media outlets found that Trump's relationship with the truth was,well, complicated."We concede all politicians lie," conservative columnist Jennifer Rubin wrote inSeptember. "Nevertheless, Donald Trump is in a class by himself.""Post-truth" was selected after Oxford's dictionary editors noted a roughly2,000 percent increase in its usage over 2015 - it was appearing with far morefrequency in news articles and on social media in both the United Kingdom andthe United States.This year, the shortlist included "adulting" (often packaged into the phrase"adulting so hard," as in, "I'm adulting so hard that I bought a leaf blower andincreased my contribution to my 401(k) retirement savings plan") and hygge,which refers to a "comfortable conviviality and feeling of contentment" centralto Danish culture."Post-truth" also beat out finalist "alt-right," a shortening of "alternativeright" defined by Oxford as "an ideological grouping associated with extremeconservative or reactionary viewpoints, characterized by a rejection ofmainstream politics and by the use of online media to disseminate deliberatelycontroversial content."Dueling wordsAnother group of lexicographers has picked "Brexit" - a fixture in headlinesaround the world throughout 2016 - as Word of the Year.Brexit - a portmanteau word blending "Britain" with "exit" - describes theU.K.'s impending departure from the European Union, in the wake of acontroversial referendum on the issue in June.The team of lexicographers behind the Collins Dictionary say it is the mostvisible English term of the past year."We believe that the obvious increased use of 'Brexit' (up 3,400% in 2016), itssignificant impact in British politics and Britain's exit from the EU make it aword not only primed for history books but also as Collins' Word of the Year,"the team said in a statement.The language experts looked at all English media - from newspapers, to radio andsocial media - to draw their conclusion.Brexit's roots can be traced back to 2012, when economist Ebrahim Rahbari coinedthe term "Grexit" as a shorthand for "Greek exit," referring to Greece'spotential withdrawal from the eurozone as a result of its economic crisis.But it is not the first time the world of politics has conjured up a word thattook on a life of its own.The new 'Watergate'?Back in 1972, "Watergate" became part of the Oxford English Dictionary after ascandal that began with a burglary in the Washington Watergate Hotel led to theeventual resignation of President Richard M. Nixon.The "-gate" suffix has since been used to denote scandals from "winegate"(chemicals used to transform vinegar into fake wine) to "horsegate" (frozenlasagnas containing horse meat) and "bridgegate."Helen Newstead, head of language content at Collins, believes Brexit will soonoverthrow Watergate." 'Brexit' is arguably politics' most important contribution to the Englishlanguage in over 40 years, since the Watergate scandal ... (and) 'Brexit' isproving even more useful and adaptable," she said.Some of the new words created from Brexit include "brexiteers" - those who votedfor the U.K. to leave the EU - and "bremorse" - the feeling of regretexperienced by those who chose to leave, and then changed their mind.'Mic drop,' 'hygge' contendersBesides Brexit, the team at Collins shortlisted other nine words as strongcontenders for the top prize."Trumpism" - a controversial statement attributed to U.S. president-elect DonaldTrump - was one of the most popular."Depending on your point of view, (Trumpism) can be held up either as evidenceof the man's ability to make America great again or else as proof of hisunfitness to hold the highest political office," explained the Collins' team."Mic drop" - "a theatrical gesture in which a person drops (or imitates theaction of dropping) a hand-held microphone to the ground as the finale to aspeech or performance" - as demonstrated by U.S. President Barack Obama at arecent dinner also made the list.Other top terms included "throw shade"; the Danish "hygge"; and "snowflakegeneration" - new young adults who are seen as less resilient than previousgenerations.LOAD-DATE: November 26, 2016LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: Newspaper
