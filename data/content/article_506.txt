WASHINGTON - Nearly three weeks after Election Day, Michigan officials certifiedMonday that Donald Trump won the state by 10,704 votes out of nearly 4.8 millionto claim all of its 16 electoral votes. There's more wrangling to come, though,on the final vote count for this contentious campaign.Jill Stein's Green Party served notice that it would petition for a Michiganrecount even as her party pushed forward with recount efforts in Wisconsin andPennsylvania, where Trump won by somewhat wider but still small margins.Should the results for Trump hold in all three states, as expected, thepresident-elect would have 306 electoral votes to 232 for Democrat HillaryClinton. It takes 270 to be elected president.Only if the results were overturned in all three states would Clinton have aclaim on the presidency, and that is widely considered to be out of thequestion.If it's any consolation for Clinton, however, - and it's probably mighty little- she's is winning the national popular vote. With some votes still beingcounted, she is ahead by more than 2 million, about 1.5 percent of the totalcounted so far.Trump, in a series of weekend tweets complaining about the Midwest recountefforts, said the Green Party was engaged in a "scam to fill up their coffers"and that "defeated & demoralized Dems" were joining in.Trump angrily denounced the recounts and now claims without evidence that he,not Clinton, would have won the popular vote if it hadn't been for "millions ofpeople who voted illegally." On Twitter, he singled out Virginia, California andNew Hampshire.There has been no indication of widespread election tampering or voter fraud inthose states or any others, and Trump aides struggled Monday to back up theirboss's claim.Spokesman Jason Miller said illegal voting was "an issue of concern." But theonly evidence he raised was a 2014 news report and a study on votingirregularities conducted before the 2016 election.PUSH CONTINUESStein, who won 1.4 million votes nationwide, or about 1 percent of the count,signaled her determination to keep pushing the Midwest recount efforts, sayingthat "Americans deserve a voting system we can trust." As of Monday, she hadraised $6.2 million to finance recounts, according to her campaign website."After a presidential election tarnished by the use of outdated and unreliablemachines and accusations of irregularities and hacks, people of all politicalpersuasions are asking if our election results are reliable," she said in astatement.There is no evidence that voter results were hacked or that electronic votingmachines were compromised.The Clinton campaign, which declined to initiate recounts on its own, said overthe weekend that it would participate in the recounts requested by Stein "toensure the process proceeds in a manner that is fair to all sides," in the wordsof campaign lawyer Marc Elias.Stein's campaign said she would file a petition Wednesday for a Michiganrecount, after which Trump would have seven days to file objections. Trump'smargin of victory in the state was a slim 0.22 percent of the total vote.Michigan Republican Party Chairwoman Ronna Romney McDaniel said a recount wouldbe "a waste of time and disrespectful to all Michigan voters."Chris Thomas, director of the Michigan Bureau of Elections, said the recountwould begin as early as Friday to meet a Dec. 13 deadline. Under state policy,the recount will be conducted by hand.He said election officials had heard a lot this year about "so-called fraud ...without any foundation in fact," and a recount settling that question couldprovide one "silver lining."MORE TO COMEIn Wisconsin, meanwhile, the state elections commission approved on Monday atimeline to start a recount on Thursday. Stein is pushing for a hand count ofthe nearly 3 million ballots cast in the state, but the commission left it up tolocal election officials to determine the best method.Stein's Wisconsin recount request included an affidavit from University ofMichigan computer scientist J. Alex Halderman stating that a hand recount is theonly way to determine whether there could have been a cyberattack that affectedthe results. He argued that records stored in electronic voting equipment couldhave been manipulated in an attack.The AP updated on Monday its election night vote count in Wisconsin to correctthe totals for both candidates in three separate counties. The updates droppedTrump's margin over Clinton to 22,460 votes from 27,257 votes, or 0.8 percent ofthe total vote. The corrections were made during the regular postelectioncanvass of the election-night vote.In Pennsylvania, where Trump edged Clinton by about 71,000 votes, or about 1percent of the vote, Stein filed a lawsuit seeking a statewide recount, but itwasn't clear if the courts had the authority to order one.Secretary of State Pedro Cortes, a Democrat, said there was no evidence ofvoting irregularities or cyberattacks on Pennsylvania's voting machines, 96percent of which record votes electronically and leave no paper trail.
