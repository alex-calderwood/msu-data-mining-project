I share the concern Eric Chenoweth expressed in his Nov. 27 op-ed, "What aboutRussia's meddling?," about the puzzling lack of focus by politicians and opinionleaders on Russia's dangerous and unprecedented manipulation of our election.Most important, as Mr. Chenoweth asked, "Where are the committee chairmen inCongress demanding an investigation? How is it that Republican Party leadersaccept the intervention of a foreign power in the election of their party'spresidential candidate?"The GOP struts its patriotism and ardent defense of American values on everystage, yet its response to this shocking and unprecedented manipulation of ourdemocracy has been feeble, at best.While Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton's management of her StateDepartment emails triggered massive GOP outrage, Russia's interventions in ourelection trigger random statements. Republicans (and Democrats) have a deepresponsibility to come together to get answers to the questions Mr. Chenowethand others have raised.R.C. Garton , Bethesda
