A top monetary policy-maker has a thinly veiled message for Donald Trump: Keepyour paws off the Fed.James Bullard, president of the St. Louis Federal Reserve, said this weekendhe's confident the president-elect won't follow through on campaign rhetoricthat had him trying to meddle in the Federal Reserve's affairs.Then-candidate Trump, in a September debate, said Chair Janet Yellen's Fed wastoo political and was keeping rates low to boost electoral prospects for theDemocrats and presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.But Bullard, who has been hawkish on an interest rate hike, said on Sunday thathe has received assurances from President-elect Trump's transition team that hewill not interfere with the Fed."President-elect Trump's transition team has said that it wants to protect Fedindependence," Bullard said. "I take them at their word."In an interview with Handelsblatt, a German magazine, Bullard noted that theFed's policy committee consists of a dozen people, and that Trump will only filla few seats."He would only gradually be able to put his stamp on the institution," Bullardsaid. "I think you'll have a lot of continuity in policy-making in themeantime."On the campaign trail, Trump pledged to fire Yellen as soon as he entered theOval Office - despite the fact that her term extends to early 2018 - claimingthat she's under pressure from the Obama administration.With Trump taking a more moderate tone since the election, most Fed watchers arenow skeptical that Trump would attempt such an obvious violation of the Fed'sindependence.Indeed, many speculate that Trump was merely pandering to the Fed-hating goldbugs in his voting base. Others have noted that Trump's real estate holdingshave benefited from easy monetary policy."If inflation was running at 15 percent as in the 1980s, that might have beenthe opportunity to say that this is not working and we have to rearrangethings," Bullard said. "That is not the case today."Earlier in the weekend, Bullard told a panel discussion in Frankfurt thatTrump's plans to stimulate growth through infrastructure building andtax-cutting could give the economy a medium-term boost before protectionism andcurbs on immigration began to take their toll."Trade is something that requires negotiation, it takes many years and therewould be impact on the economy and that would be ... perhaps 10 years," Bullardsaid. " The same with immigration."
