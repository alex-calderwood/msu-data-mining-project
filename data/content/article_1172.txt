HIGHLIGHT: There are many reasons Donald J. Trump's claim doesn't withstandscrutiny.Usually, the burden of proof for an outlandish claim rests on the person makingthe assertion. But Donald J. Trump is a master of making big claims, challengingothers to disprove them and benefiting from the debate.On Sunday, he alleged that Hillary Clinton won the popular vote because ofmillions of illegal votes, presumably many of them cast in California, which isstill counting votes and which is providing her with much of hertwo-million-plus-vote advantage. He said there was "serious voter fraud inVirginia, New Hampshire and California."Mr. Trump has offered no evidence for this statement. That's because there isn'tany.California's turnout was low.If there were a few million fraudulent votes, the turnout rate in Californiawould presumably be quite high. It was not. The turnout rate in California isprojected to finish below the national average, according to estimates byMichael McDonald of the United States Elections Project. The turnout rate isbased on the state's voting-eligible population, which excludes noncitizens.If California had a low turnout despite millions of noncitizen voters, itsturnout rate would be among the lowest in the country - edging just above Hawaiiand Utah for third lowest.Other Republicans did quite well.You would expect signs of noncitizen voting in the results. Mr. Trump would havepresumably lost the most ground in areas with large noncitizen populations.Instead, his biggest losses came on the affluent coast: in Orange and Marincounties, in San Diego and Silicon Valley.He underperformed Mitt Romney's 2012 showing most in Orange County, a redoubt of20th-century conservatism that voted Republican in every election from 1936through 2012. Mr. Trump lost the county by a nine-point margin.These same Orange County residents voted to re-elect all four of theirRepublican members of Congress - not the result one would expect if Mrs. Clintonwere bolstered by a wave of unanimously Democratic illegal votes.Studies cited don't support it.When asked on Monday for evidence to support Mr. Trump's assertions, JasonMiller, his communications director, cited two studies that he said offeredexamples of voter fraud: a 2014 Washington Post study on noncitizen voting and a2012 Pew study on the poor state of voter registration files.Neither study could plausibly be construed to indicate that millions of illegalvoters cast ballots in this election. Both were conducted well in advance of theelection, and neither supports anything like what Mr. Trump has suggested.What Mr. Miller referred to as the "Washington Post study" - actually an articleby two professors on The Post's Monkey Cage blog - used a survey to concludethat 6.4 percent of noncitizen adults voted in the 2008 election.This study was widely criticized and later debunked. But even taken at facevalue, a 6.4 percent noncitizen voting rate would account for only one-fourth ofMrs. Clinton's margin of victory in the popular vote.And there is little reason to think that 6.4 percent of noncitizens voted in the2008 election. The finding is based on the Cooperative Congressional ElectionStudy, a huge study of tens of thousands of respondents. The 6.4 percent isbased on just 21 survey respondents who indicated that they were noncitizens andvoted.That tiny number of respondents out of the tens of thousands who took the surveyhints at a different explanation: measurement error.Sometimes people make mistakes when they take a survey. They might misunderstandthe question, accidentally give a wrong response to an interviewer or press thewrong button online. The interviewer can make a mistake, and record the wronganswer. This usually isn't a significant problem, but it becomes one if you'retrying to find an odd, small finding in a survey of 30,000 people. Even if 99.9percent of people answered a question correctly in the survey, there would stillbe 30 erroneous answers out of 30,000.It turns out that number isn't far off. The study is a panel survey, so manypeople had been interviewed in previous years. A comparison of their previousanswers can help give a sense of just how often people might make a mistake. In2012, 20 of the self-described noncitizens surveyed reported that they had beencitizens when they took the survey in 2010. But that's unlikely - very fewpeople lose their citizenship.What's more, a similar number, 36 people, said they were noncitizens in 2010 butcitizens in 2012. That's possible - since people can obtain citizenship - butthe finding is well above the rate of naturalization.This phenomenon could explain all of the noncitizen voting in the congressionalelection study. Here's the clincher: There were zero voters among therespondents who indicated that they were noncitizens in both 2010 and 2012.Mr. Miller's citation of aPew Research study on the quality of voterregistration files is far less salient. Yes, there are many millions of peoplewho remain registered to vote after they have moved or died: Very few peopleremove themselves from the voter rolls when they move, or as they lie on theirdeathbed. But this has nothing to do with noncitizen voting, and it is not ameaningful contributor to voter fraud.Allegations of fraud by the left doesn't mean fraud has occurred.The political right has not been alone in making unsubstantiated claims aboutelection or voter fraud this year. Some supporters of Bernie Sanders did thesame thing in the primaries. The Green Party presidential candidate Jill Steinis pushing for recounts in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, though norecount has ever overturned a lead as large as Mr. Trump's in these states.Last week, a New York Magazine article made a splash by saying that somecomputer scientists believed there was evidence of voting irregularities inWisconsin, based on Mr. Trump's stronger showing in counties with electronicvoting. This appears to be a mischaracterization of their views, but the viewexpressed in the article doesn't hold up either. Mr. Trump's edge inelectronic-voting counties can be explained by their demographics: The countiesare less educated and whiter than the parts of the state with paper ballots.Ultimately, there's not much that's odd about the results. Mrs. Clintonunderperformed in Wisconsin, but also in Iowa and Minnesota - states with paperballots and, in Minnesota's case, a Democratic government. She fared well inCalifornia, but gained just as much in Texas, a state with Republicangovernment.There's a dominant pattern: Mr. Trump's strength with white working-class votershelped him a lot in crucial battleground states like Michigan and Pennsylvania.Mrs. Clinton had strength with Hispanic voters and well-educated white voters,but it helped her more in noncompetitive states, like Texas and California.These demographic patterns help explain the results without any need to suspectvoter fraud.The Upshot provides news, analysis and graphics about politics, policy andeveryday life.
