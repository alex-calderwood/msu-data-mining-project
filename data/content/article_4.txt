BERLIN - Can Germany, the country that once unleashed Nazism, lead the freeworld?The idea that the former home of militarism and nationalism could become abeacon for human rights and peaceful international cooperation within onelifetime may seem far-fetched.But with outsider Donald Trump's election as U.S. president and the risingstrength of far-right and populist movements in Europe, some have suggested thatGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel is left as the last powerful defender of liberalvalues in the West.Since taking office in 2005, Merkel has been a fixture of the internationalsummit circuit, often providing the only dash of color in row upon row of graysuits.She has outlasted most of her contemporaries - save for Russian PresidentVladimir Putin - and won plaudits for successfully steering her country throughthe turmoil of the global financial crisis.Along the way, the trained physicist has deftly maintained relations with alliesas they gained new leaders, including prime ministers and presidents whosepositions were very different from her own."I could not have asked for a steady and more reliable partner on the worldstage," President Barack Obama said Thursday after meeting with Merkel in Berlinduring his final foreign tour. He described the German chancellor as "a greatfriend and ally" who looks out for her own country's interests while recognizingthat this also requires working with others to solve common problems.Merkel raised eyebrows last week when she departed from the usual diplomaticscript after Trump's election by suggesting that respect for liberal values wasa precondition for Berlin's continued good relations with Washington. Manycommentators saw her remarks as a sign that the chancellor was prepared tothrust Germany into the forefront of international politics and challenge thenew U.S. administration if necessary.Standing beside Obama, she pledged to "do everything to work well with the newpresident" but insisted that the basis for cooperation would have to be"democracy, freedom and human rights worldwide and to strive for an open andliberal world order."Obama's decision to stop in Germany for two days reinforced the image of himpassing the baton to Merkel. Rather than bid farewell to Europe in Paris, thecapital of America's oldest ally, or in Britain - which prides itself on havinga "special relationship" with Washington - Obama's choice signaled a recognitionthat the heart of the old continent now lies in Berlin.The leaders of Europe's other major powers - Britain, France, Italy and Spain -will meet Obama in the German capital Friday, a day after he confers at lengthwith Merkel."The phrase 'leader of the free world' is usually applied to the president ofthe United States, and rarely without irony," Timothy Garton Ash, a historianand professor of European studies at Oxford University, wrote Friday inBritain's left-leaning Guardian newspaper. "I'm tempted to say that the leaderof the free world is now Angela Merkel."Yet skeptics point out that Merkel may not be suited to rally the West.Her decision last year to open Germany's borders to hundreds of thousands ofpeople fleeing war and poverty was seized upon by European nationalists andfeatured prominently in Britain's debate over quitting the European Union -which the 'leave' camp narrowly won.European allies blame her for earlier stoking popular unrest by insisting on theneed to cut public spending during the continent's debt crisis. And in Ukraine,Merkel's recent efforts to maintain a united European front in the face ofRussian aggression are looking increasingly fragile.Domestically, Merkel is battling a new nationalist foe in the form ofAlternative for Germany, a party that has surged in popularity by railingagainst refugees. Rather than confronting the party head-on, Merkel has insteadstuck to her measured mantra of "We will manage.""Germany can't replace the United States as the leader of the free world," JosefBraml, an expert on international affairs at the German Council on ForeignRelations, said."At best, it can protect Europe from nationalist tendencies and remind Americathat the liberal world order it established is also in the economic interests ofthe United States. That's something the new businessman in the White Houseshould be able to understand."
