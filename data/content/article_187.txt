"DACA beneficiaries on our campuses have been exemplary studentscholars and student leaders, working across campus and in the community."With DACA, our students and alumni have been able to pursue opportunities inbusiness, education, high tech, and the non-profit sector; they have gone tomedical school, law school, and graduate schools in numerous disciplines. Theyare actively contributing to their local communities and economies."The policy was a product of the Obama administration and many now wonder aboutits future under the administration of President-elect Donald Trump, who madeincreased immigration enforcement and even curtailing the entry of someimmigrants a central part of his presidential campaign. On the campaign trail,Trump has said he would repeal DACA if elected.Oxtoby is hoping Trump will change his mind."To our country's leaders, we say that DACA should be upheld, continued, andexpanded," the statement says. "We are prepared to meet with you to present ourcase. This is both a moral imperative and a national necessity. America needstalent - and these students, who have been raised and educated in the UnitedStates, are already part of our national community. They represent what is bestabout America, and as scholars and leaders they are essential to the future."According to Pomona College spokeswoman Patricia Cecilia Zurita, "dozens ofpresidents have joined the initiative already."As of 10:30 a.m. Monday, more than 130 college and university presidents frompublic and private institutions have a signed statement offering to meet withU.S. leaders on the issue.Oxtoby's letter puts him in step with other California educators andpoliticians, including California State University Chancellor Tim White, andCalifornia attorney general turned Senator Kamala Harris.
