Republican electoral successes, a large Electoral College victory whilemaintaining control of both houses of Congress, shocked many. A complete look atthe data, however, suggests that the real story of the election is the continuedslow death of our two major parties.The Trump victory in particular has broadly been interpreted as produced bywhite, working-class voters without post-secondary degrees, a disenfranchisedsilent majority frustrated with elite indifference and condescension that votedto shake up the American political system. This explanation, however, fails toincorporate all the relevant electoral facts, most notably turnout andincumbency advantage.While turnout increased in our state, it remained below the national average andparticipation nationwide declined from 2012. As a percentage of the Americanvoting age population, turnout nationwide was lower than all but fourpresidential elections since 1924. When all the votes are counted Trump's totalwill trail not only Clinton's vote this year but also Romney's vote in 2012.That means Trump's substantial Electoral College victory can be generallyattributed not to white, working-class voters who were newly mobilized fromeither abstention or from the Democratic Party, but rather to the fact thatClinton got only about 90 percent of the votes that Obama received in 2012.Finally, the Republican Party lost seats in both the Senate and the House,although not as many in either as generally expected. More significantly,though, House incumbents, Republicans and Democrats alike, lost only five racesout of nearly 400. A real, establishment-swamping wave election would not haveTrump getting fewer votes than Romney or witness the return to the much-scornedHouse of Representatives 99 percent of its incumbents.Research explores why this campaign produced lower turnout in general, why theClinton campaign suffered disproportionately and why Congress will remainvirtually unchanged despite widespread public dissatisfaction with itsperformance. Negative campaigns discourage voters and, when practiced by bothmajor parties, drive voters to actively abstain by voting third-party.Between them, Clinton and Trump will get nearly seven million fewer votes thanObama and Romney collectively received in 2012; about half of those missingvotes can be attributed to total abstention and the rest went to Johnson, Stein,McMullin and others.Voter attachment to parties has been undermined by the mass media and interestgroups. These alternate linkage institutions prefer conflict, spectacle andsingle-issue stridency to collaboration and compromise, producing campaigns thatare as expensive and negative as they are vapid.Many scholars lament the decline of parties, which serve important functions ina democracy: organizing support for and opposition to policy proposals;facilitating action in a federal system of separate branches sharing power thatwas designed to impede such action; mobilizing mass participation; and takingresponsibility for successes, failures and compromises with the opposing partyeven if taking responsibility entails incumbents losing elections.The decline of parties has been forecast for a long time. A quarter-century ago,the authors of Politics by Other Means associated with parties the acronym RIP(revelation, investigation and prosecution) - activities driven byinterest-group funding and media sensationalism. A bit more recently, bothThomas Frank's "What's the Matter with Kansas and Stanley Greenberg's "The TwoAmericas predicted the movement of white working-class voters to the RepublicanParty.It looks like these class-based models of voting have been realized and thatdemography now supersedes partisanship as the primary determinant ofpresidential voting behavior, at least in our state. While our partisan voterregistration continues to favor the Democrats, electoral loyalty to theDemocratic candidate did not survive the Obama or Clinton campaigns, and it'sdoubtful that habits discarded over three presidential election cycles willreappear in 2020.A replacement of partisanship with demography might lead to more intense andcompetitive presidential campaigns, but it probably does not bode well for ourdemocracy and our ability to actually solve problems like low wages, crumblinginfrastructure, educational under-achievement, addiction and debt.Although progress was often slow, America was more successful at solving theseproblems when our parties were stronger. Feckless governance has been the priceof our corresponding collective civic disengagement. We can hope for better, butthat is not a reasonable expectation.James A.
