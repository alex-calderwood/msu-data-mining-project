The Philadelphia city commissioners have agreed to recount some ballots cast inthe city, as requested by Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein, butrejected a forensic audit of how those voting machines work.The commissioners, in a brief meeting Thursday, agreed to start recounting onFriday ballots in 75 divisions after Stein's campaign filed at least threeaffidavits for each division from voters there asking for a recount.They rejected requests for seven other divisions. Philadelphia has 1,686 votingdivisions.Ilann Maazel, an attorney for Stein's campaign, told the commissioners the stateElection Code allows for an examination of the machines. Citing examples ofhacking of elections computer systems in Illinois and Arizona, along with theDemocratic National Committee's emails, he said a forensic audit ofPhiladelphia's voting machine software was the only way to determine whetherthey had been hacked."To examine means to look inside," Maazel said.Lawrence Tabas, general counsel for the Pennsylvania Republican Party, counteredthat Stein's campaign had an opportunity for a public inspection of the city'svoting machines before the election and chose not to attend.Tabas cited an Oct. 20 statement from Pennsylvania Secretary of State PedroCortes, a Democrat, who said the state's "voting systems are secure" and themachines were not connected to the internet or each other."There is no opportunity to hack these machines," Tabas said. "There is noopportunity to corrupt them."Stein's campaign has not offered proof of election tampering, instead relying onaffidavits from computer scientists who put forward the theory that votingmachines are vulnerable to hacking.Tabas also accused the Stein campaign of "cherry-picking" some divisions forrecounts.Maazel insisted Stein would support a full recount of every ballot.Stein won 6,486 votes in Philadelphia, or 0.95 percent of the ballots cast. Shewon 0.82 percent of the vote in Pennsylvania and 1 percent nationwide.Republican nominee Donald Trump defeated Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton inPennsylvania by 1.1 percent, a key victory in his election as the nextpresident.A judge in Montgomery County on Wednesday rejected a request from Stein torecount ballots in 72 of 425 precincts there.Stein is also pursuing recounts in other Pennsylvania counties and in severalother states.In Bucks County, a judge will hear arguments Tuesday in Doylestown on whether togrant a recount of votes in 24 of the county's 304 precincts.Stein's campaign also filed a petition Monday in Commonwealth Court seeking ajudicial order for a recount. That petition will have a hearing in Harrisburg onMonday.Tabas, after Thursday's hearing in Philadelphia, predicted Stein would fail."They are simply doing this for purposes to delay the inauguration of the nextpresident because they're not happy with the outcome," Tabas said.brennac@phillynews.com215-854-5973@ByChrisBrennanStaff writer Caitlin McCabe contributed to this article.Montco judge rejects presidential-vote recount requesthttp://www.philly.com/philly/news/politics/presidential/20161201_Montco_judge_rejects_presidential-vote_recount_request.htmlPa. court sets hearing for Stein recount petitionhttp://www.philly.com/philly/news/politics/presidential/20161130_Pa__court_sets_hearing_for_Stein_recount_petition.html
