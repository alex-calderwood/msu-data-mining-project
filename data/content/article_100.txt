THANKSGIVINGMARY ELLEN WRIGHTMWRIGHT@LNPNEWS.COMIn many households across Lancaster County and elsewhere this year, theThanksgiving turkey will be accompanied by the elephant in the room.It's that pesky presidential election, which has left a trail of vociferousfamily arguments, bruised feelings and in-your-face social media posts.So how will we all get through it - wanting to break bread with family memberson the other side of the political divide and yet fearing what they might say ifthe topic of politics comes up?Facing or avoidingSome are avoiding Thanksgiving gatherings altogether. Others are going, butpreparing for what may come.Take Bobbi and Tom Heil, of Lancaster, who voted for Hillary Clinton and areheading to the Baltimore area to spend Thanksgiving with immediate and extendedfamily."It'll be a diverse group," Bobbi Heil said. "About half voted for (Donald)Trump and half voted for Hillary. This year may be a little more tense (thanusual), but I think we've decided that the family being together and enjoyingthe day is more important than rehashing all the (election) problems."There will be some jokes - there always are - and some digs. But we have threegranddaughters, and we want to be good role models for them."For that one day, you can just swallow it and talk about something else," sheadded.MaryRose Brunn, of Leola, is thankful she won't be getting together with herfamily - which includes her parents and 10 siblings, many in the Pittsburgh area- until a gathering in Maryland two days after Christmas.Her parents are extremely conservative; her siblings are a mix of liberals andconservatives."When (my family) talks politics, sometimes people leave the room," Brunn said."There are people who won't speak to each other for months when it comes topolitics. It's very divisive."Brunn considers herself a libertarian and voted for Gary Johnson for presidentas an alternative to the two major-party candidates. Her family reacted badly toher decision, she noted."I'm terribly sad everyone is so angry," she said. "I'm escaping the whole thinguntil the big get-together is planned (at Christmastime). I'm hoping things willhave calmed down by then."Avoid the topic"My suggestion would be to not bring up the election," said Rosa A. CabezasFetterman, a licensed psychologist with New Life Counseling Services in MountJoy."One of the things I tell my clients is to not let the emotions flood theintellect," Fetterman said. "You have to use your intellect, you have to usewisdom ... but you can't do that when your emotions are flooding you. You'll saythings that you regret."(Unity) needs to start in those practical, day-to-day settings. Thanksgiving isa wonderful time of the year to celebrate and be grateful," Fetterman said."There's a scriptural verse, Ephesians 4:29, that comes to mind," said the Rev.Joe DiPaolo, senior pastor of the First United Methodist Church of Lancaster,said. "It says, 'Do not let any unwholesome talk come out of your mouths, butonly what is helpful for building others up according to their needs, that itmay benefit those who listen.'"The verse "tells us to think about what we're going to say before we open ourmouths, and ask, 'Will what I'm about to say provide anything positive to thosearound me?'" DiPaolo said."When we're either tempted to vent on the one hand or gloat on the other,"DiPaolo said, "you know that's not necessarily going to contribute to anythingpositive."If you're dreading Thanksgiving with family because of the election aftermath,advised Gerald Ressler, a licensed clinical counselor and executive director ofSamaritan Counseling Services of Lancaster, "make sure you're at a place whereyou can go, and engage, and it's not going to be detrimental to your emotionalwell-being,"If you can't go, Ressler said, you can "send a note expressing a desire toremain connected" and add it just doesn't work for you this year.If someone starts a political argument at the Thanksgiving table, Ressler said,"remember that what's important is the relationship with your family members.That's more important than trying to convince them they're wrong and you'reright. "'Difficult relatives'Maureen Leader, a public relations professional who lives in Lancaster, won'tsay who she supported in the election. But she knows she and her husband will bein the minority among political opinions at Thanksgiving dinner with siblings,in-laws and others.She plans to handle the political divide "by keeping my mouth shut.""Our family hardly ever gets together and I love my family. So why waste thistime on something that could cause rancor?"No one is going to change their mind anyway," she said. "It's not like, 'oh youknow, you're absolutely right, Maureen. I really should have voted for yourcandidate. Please pass the mashed potatoes. ...' ""But just to be sure," Leader added, "I am bringing wine with a cute wooden signon it ... that says, 'Goes well with turkey and difficult relatives.' And I'msaying that WE'RE the difficult relatives."- Bobbi Heil, of LancasterIf you're going to avoid letting a contentious political discussion ruin yourThanksgiving dinner, you might want to avoid the topic of the electionaltogether.Counselors and clergy recommend talking about something other than politicsaround the holiday table to keep family relations peaceful. For the host of thedinner, that may mean having other discussion topics at the ready.Five years ago, AARP Bulletin published a list of multigenerationalconversation-starters families can use around the Thanksgiving table.These "story starters," AARP said, are designed to help family members "ask eachother questions, share something new and, perhaps, bridge a generation gap."Family members can take turns filling in the blank to such topics as:"The historical moment I remember best is ______.""One time, I got in hot water when ______," and its corollary, "But I didn't getcaught when ______.""My favorite toy was ______.""My best surprise ever was ______.""My first kiss was ______.""A secret I wish I hadn't kept is ______.""Something I wish was still sold in stores is ______.""My first music player was a ______ and I liked to listen to ______ on it.""My favorite thing about someone at this table is ______."(Two topics on the list you might want to skip: "Politically, I consider myselfa ______," and"My religion is ______ because ______.")The list is online on AARP's website:bit.ly/AARPStoryStarters.- Mary Ellen Wright- Rev.
