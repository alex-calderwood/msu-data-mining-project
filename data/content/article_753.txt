On Friday, Wisconsin stateelections officials said they would move forward with the first presidentialrecount in state history.In his post, Elias outlined the steps the campaign has taken since the electionto rule in or out the possibility of any outside interference in the vote tally.Though their post-election audit did not uncover "any actionable evidence ofhacking or outside attempts to alter the voting technology," Elias said theywill participate in the Wisconsin recount."Because we had not uncovered any actionable evidence of hacking or outsideattempts to alter the voting technology, we had not planned to exercise thisoption ourselves," he wrote. "But now that a recount has been initiated inWisconsin, we intend to participate in order to ensure the process proceeds in amanner that is fair to all sides. If Jill Stein follows through as she haspromised and pursues recounts in Pennsylvania and Michigan, we will take thesame approach in those states as well."Read more: Jill Stein Files for Wisconsin Election RecountClinton's lead in the national popular vote now exceeds more than 2 millionvotes.President-elect Donald Trump's combined margin in Michigan, Wisconsin andPennsylvania  was 107,000 votes.While there is no evidence of election tampering in the states, Green Partyspokesman George Martin said on Friday that "the American public needs to haveit investigated to make sure our votes count."Elias said officials in the Clinton campaign have received "hundreds" ofmessages, emails and calls urging the investigation into claims that theelection results were hacked."This election cycle was unique in the degree of foreign interference witnessedthroughout the campaign," Elias wrote on Saturday. "The U.S. governmentconcluded that Russian state actors were behind the hacks of the DemocraticNational Committee and the personal email accounts of Hillary for Americacampaign officials, and just yesterday, the Washington Post reported that theRussian government was behind much of the 'fake news' propaganda that circulatedonline in the closing weeks of the election."

"AsHillary Clinton herself said on election night, in addition to her conceding bycongratulating me, 'We must accept this result and then look to the future.'"In his statement, Trump said he won 306 electoral votes, the most of anyRepublican since 1988, and carried nine of 13 battleground states."This recount is just a way for Jill Stein, who received less than one percentof the vote overall and wasn't even on the ballot in many states, to fill hercoffers with money, most of which she will never even spend on this ridiculousrecount," he said. "All three states were won by large numbers of voters,especially Pennsylvania, which was won by more than 70,000 votes."Trump's statement continued: "This is a scam by the Green Party for an electionthat has already been conceded, and the results of this election should berespected instead of being challenged and abused, which is exactly what JillStein is doing."Read more: Trump Team Ignores Recount Questions, Focuses on New Hires
