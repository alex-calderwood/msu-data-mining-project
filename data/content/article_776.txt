WASHINGTON - A top Donald Trump adviser warned Sunday that the president-elect'ssupporters would feel "betrayed" if he tapped former Massachusetts Gov. MittRomney as secretary of state, a move that would put a once-fierce Trump criticin a powerful Cabinet post.The comments from Kellyanne Conway deepened a highly unusual push by some Trumpallies to stop the president-elect from nominating Romney. The extraordinarypublic nature of the effort has also stirred speculation that it could be aTrump-approved attempt to humiliate a prominent Republican who staunchly opposedhim throughout the presidential campaign.Conway, who served as Trump's campaign manager and is part of his transitionteam, said her opposition to Romney reflected what she's been hearing from Trumpvoters."People feel betrayed to think that Gov. Romney, who went out of his way toquestion the character and the intellect and the integrity of Donald Trump, nowour president-elect, would be given the most significant cabinet post of all,Conway said in one of several television interviews Sunday. She said Romney was"nothing but awful to Trump for a year.Conway's opposition to Romney is also said to be supported by Steve Bannon, thecontroversial conservative media executive who will serve as Trump's White Housesenior adviser.Trump is an avid consumer of television news and his advisers and allies oftenuse their appearances to send messages to Trump or the Republican establishment.Still, it's rare for Conway and other close aides who speak frequently withTrump in private to be so explicit about their personal opinions in public.Romney, the 2012 GOP nominee, vigorously challenged Trump's fitness for thepresidency, including his foreign policy credentials. In a wide-rangingcondemnation of Trump in March, Romney said the businessman's bombast was"alarming the allies and fueling the enmity of our enemies.Trump responded by mocking Romney, calling him a "choker and saying he "walkslike a penguin.The freeze between two men appeared to thaw after they spoke by phone followingthe election. Romney then traveled to Trump's New Jersey golf club for a privatemeeting to discuss the possibility of joining the administration.After the meeting, Trump was said to be taken by the way Romney "looks the partof a globe-trotting diplomat, according to people close to the transitionprocess.In nominating Romney, Trump would be signaling his willingness to heal campaignwounds and reach out to traditional Republicans who were deeply skeptical of hisexperience and temperament. Romney is well-liked by GOP lawmakers and wassupported by numerous Republican national security experts during his failedWhite House bid.But Conway suggested those weren't reasons enough to nominate Romney as thenation's top diplomat."I'm all for party unity, but I'm not sure that we have to pay for that with thesecretary of state position, Conway said.Despite the effort to discredit him, Romney is said to remain interested inserving in Trump's Cabinet, though those close to him acknowledge his oppositionto Trump during the campaign hurt his chances.Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who was fiercely loyal to Trumpthroughout the campaign, quickly emerged as a front-runner for the secretary ofstate post and is still in contention. However, questions about his overseasbusiness ties - as well as his own public campaigning for the job - are said tohave given Trump pause.Giuliani is said to be frustrated by the way the process has unfolded, havingoriginally been led to believe he would have his pick of jobs, according tothose close to the transition. They insisted on anonymity because they were notauthorized to publicly discuss the private deliberations.Trump's decision on his secretary of state did not appear to be imminent. Andthe wrangling over Romney and Giuliani has raised the possibility that Trump maygo with a third option. His transition team has also considered Tennessee Sen.Bob Corker and former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton for thejob.People with knowledge of the transition process say Trump is also consideringretired Marine Gen. John Kelly for the post.Kelly met with the president-elect last week.Conway appeared Sunday on NBC's "Meet the Press, ABC's "This Week, and CNN's"State of the Union.
