HIGHLIGHT:Â Mr. Baldwin played a stunned and unprepared president-elect in thecold open of "Saturday Night Live."Alec Baldwin's return to "Saturday Night Live" this weekend prompted anotherfiery response from President-elect Donald J. Trump on Twitter.I watched parts of @nbcsnl Saturday Night Live last night. It is a totallyone-sided, biased show - nothing funny at all. Equal time for us? - Donald J.Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 20, 2016The episode's cold open features Mr. Baldwin portraying Mr. Trump as stunned andunprepared for the reality of being president. In the skit, he meets withvarious figures, including Kate McKinnon's Kellyanne Conway, a campaign stafferfrom coal country and a general, who is eager to hear about thepresident-elect's secret plan to defeat ISIS. After the general leaves, Mr.Trump promptly begins searching online for "What is Isis?" Mr. Trump proceeds torenege on assorted campaign promises, including repealing Obamacare, deportingillegal immigrants and creating coal-mining jobs.[Video:  Watch on YouTube.]Jason Sudeikis, a former cast member now starring in an Off Broadway productionof "Dead Poets Society," appeared as Mitt Romney, and Beck Bennett played VicePresident-elect Mike Pence, who was confronted by the "Hamilton" cast on Friday.In the sketch, Mr. Trump asks him about attending that Broadway show and Mr.Pence responds evenhandedly, "It was good; I got a free lecture."Early Sunday morning, Mr. Trump took to Twitter to first double down on hiscriticism of "Hamilton," before turning his attention to "Saturday Night Live."The cast and producers of Hamilton, which I hear is highly overrated, shouldimmediately apologize to Mike Pence for their terrible behavior - Donald J.Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 20, 2016The "Saturday Night Live" episode was hosted by the former cast member KristenWiig, and did not shy away from political commentary. (Last week's episode,hosted by Dave Chappelle, skipped an overly political cold open in favor of KateMcKinnon dressed as Hillary Clinton singing Leonard Cohen's "Hallelujah.") Oneskit served as an advertisement for the liberal bubble, with the tagline: "Inhere, it's like the election never happened." Another skit revealed outraged CNNanchors to be repetitive, malfunctioning androids from HBO's "Westworld."And on "Weekend Update," Michael Che and Colin Jost discussed the election andquestioned Mr. Trump's desire to be president. Mr. Che said: "He just liked thechase. He enjoyed wooing America for 18 months."Later on Sunday, Mr. Baldwin responded to Mr. Trump through his foundation'sTwitter account, and hinted that he would continue to perform as Mr. Trump onthe show....@realDonaldTrump Equal time?Election is over.
