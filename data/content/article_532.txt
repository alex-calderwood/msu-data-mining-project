Those pesky protesters. Some didn't even vote. "If you didn't vote, you cannotcomplain," say "vote-shamers" in the Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump peanutgallery.Yeah. If every one of the 1,000 or so protesters who showed up at the Capitollast week had voted for Clinton, she would've lost Utah by only about 177,000votes.Fact is, except for a handful of races in Salt Lake County, judicial retentionsand bond initiatives, casting a vote in Utah was mostly redundant; winners andlosers were a safe bet. My votes for president, governor, state Legislature,U.S. House and U.S. Senate ccc the most prominent and possibly most importantraces ccc had symbolic meaning only.Perhaps some of the protesters were angry in a generic sense, realizing thatnothing they could've done ccc voting or any other level of participation thisside of armed revolution ccc would've changed the outcome of the presidentialelection. Trump won despite a clear majority for Clinton thanks to an arcane18th-century invention, the Electoral College, created for probably good reasonsthen but only stifling democracy now.We can expect more vote-shaming and unfocused protests until major democraticreform efforts targeting gerrymandering, voter suppression, campaign financing,influence of narrow-interest lobbying, political party operations, the role ofnews media and more are taken seriously.Six years ago, two Utah nonpartisan groups, Utahns for Ethical Government andFair Boundaries, began conversations regarding several of these structuralproblems. It's time to start talking again.Bill KeshlearSalt Lake City
