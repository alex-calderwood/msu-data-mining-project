HIGHLIGHT:Â McGahn McFarlandWASHINGTON - President-elect Donald Trump on Friday named a libertarian electionlawyer as his White House counsel and a hard-line former Reagan administrationofficial to a top post on his national security staff.Trump announced that Donald McGahn, a controversial former member of the FederalElection Commission who had served as Trump's campaign lawyer, will be his WhiteHouse counsel.In that job, McGahn will serve as the president's legal adviser - a job that hasinvolved occasionally arguing to restrain what the chief executive wants to do.For deputy national security adviser, Trump chose Kathleen "KT" McFarland, whoin her most recent role as a Fox News analyst has expressed strident oppositionto many of President Barack Obama's national security policies.She will serve as deputy under the national security adviser-designee MichaelFlynn, a retired lieutenant general and a fierce critic of Obama's stances onIslamic extremism.Meanwhile, failed Green Party candidate Jill Stein took new steps to forcerecounts across key Midwestern battlegrounds that could complicate Trump's pushfor  unity.Stein, who earned little more than 1 percent of the national vote, formallyrequested a Wisconsin recount Friday, vowing to do the same in the coming daysin Michigan and Pennsylvania. There is no evidence of election tampering in thestates where Trump scored razor-thin victories, but Green Party spokesman GeorgeMartin insisted "the American public needs to have it investigated to make sureour votes count.""We're doing this to ensure the integrity of our system," he said.Trump's Nov. 8 victory was unexpected and, by some measures, historic.Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton leads the national popular vote by close to 2million votes. Trump scored narrow victories in key battleground states,however, giving him the necessary 270 electoral votes to assume office.Trump's team ignored questions about the looming recounts. Set to assume thepresidency in 55 days, the president-elect was focused instead on the task ofbuilding an administration from scratch.In a statement, Trump cited McFarland's "tremendous experience and innatetalent" and said McGahn "has a brilliant legal mind, excellent character and adeep understanding of constitutional law."Neither McGahn nor McFarland will require Senate confirmation.Trump's presidency will present his White House counsel with new - andunprecedented - challenges. The president-elect has said that his family willcontinue to run his global business enterprises, which could raise a host ofpotential conflicts of interest as he makes policy decisions at home and indealing with foreign governments.During his presidential campaign, Trump also suggested that he will take anexpansive approach to executive power.Among other things, Trump has talked of establishing a religious test forimmigrants and setting up a national stop-and-frisk program.Associated Press contributed.
