In the wake of the 2016 presidential election, many are wondering why thecandidate who received the most votes did not win. Just as happened in the 2000election cycle, the Electoral College was responsible for tilting the outcome infavor of the loser of the popular vote. So why do we continue to have a systemthat effectively disenfranchises hundreds of thousands of voters?Hillary Clinton is leading in the popular vote by well over a million votes.When the loser's margin of victory in the popular vote is this high, isn't ittime to reconsider how we conduct our most important election?Some have said the system is rigged, and it seems it is, but not in the wayDonald Trump has claimed. Is there any doubt that he would be crying foul if theresults were reversed?We can eliminate the effect of the Electoral College without doing away with it(that would require a constitutional amendment and is not likely to happen). TheNational Popular Vote movement has made progress in 11 states where legislationhas been enacted that requires all Electoral College votes in those states to becast for the winner of the national popular vote. However, the law will not takeeffect until enough states sign on so that a minimum of 270 electoral votes aremandated by the law. To date the 11 states account for 165 electoral votes, sowe have a way to go.Let us urge our Pennsylvania legislators to pass National Popular Votelegislation as soon as possible.TONY CAPRIOTTIPenn HillsLOAD-DATE: November 22, 2016LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: Newspaper
