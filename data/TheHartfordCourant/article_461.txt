LANSING, Mich. - Green Party presidential nominee Jill Stein on Wednesdayrequested a full hand recount of Michigan's presidential vote, making it thethird state narrowly won by Republican Donald Trump where she wants another lookat the results.Stein previously asked for recounts  in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.Trump, the president-elect, defeated  Hillary Clinton by about 10,700 votes outof nearly 4.8 million ballots cast in Michigan, or two-tenths of a percentagepoint. But Stein alleges that irregularities and the possibility that votescanning devices could have been hacked call the results into question.Elections officials in all three states have expressed confidence in theresults.Michigan's recount could start as early as Friday, though a challenge  by Trumpmay delay it."We simply won't know if there was hacking or interference in this electionunless we look at the votes - every vote systematically, impartially and byhand," Jessica Clarke, a lawyer for the Stein campaign, said during a newsconference outside of the Michigan Bureau of Elections.University of Michigan computer scientist Alex Halderman, who says votingmachines and optical scanners that count ballots are prone to errors and outsidemanipulation, told reporters that the recount will show "for sure" whethercyberattacks have occurred."More importantly, (the recount) will provide a defense in the future and adeterrent to any adversary who might want to try to hack future elections."Trump's victory is highly unlikely to be reversed in any of the states.The GOP says a Michigan recount would cost taxpayers far more than the $973,000Stein paid when filing her recount petition.Secretary of State Ruth Johnson, a Republican, called Stein's request "unusual,"especially because  there is no evidence of fraud or "even a credible allegationof any tampering."Meanwhile in Wisconsin, where Trump defeated Clinton by roughly 22,000 votes,Stein's campaign said it won't appeal a judge's ruling that Wisconsin's recountcan be done without counting every ballot by hand. Most counties plan to do handrecounts anyway. That recount is due to start Thursday.Trump defeated Clinton in Pennsylvania by about 71,000 votes, or about 1percentage point.
