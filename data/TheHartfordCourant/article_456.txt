HIGHLIGHT:Â David Petraeus met with Donald Trump on Monday as the president-electexpands his search for secretary of state.BEHAR ANTHONY/ EPAWASHINGTON - President-elect Donald Trump is for now unswayed by theextraordinarily public revolt by some of his top advisers and allies over thepossible choice of Mitt Romney as secretary of state and continues to see hisfoe as a serious contender for the diplomatic post, several people briefed onthe deliberations said Monday.Romney plans to have a private dinner Tuesday with Trump, who is said to beintrigued by the notion of reconciling with one of his fiercest Republicanantagonists - even as he also weighs rewarding the loyalty of former New YorkMayor Rudy  Giuliani with one of the administration's most prized jobs orselecting a decorated military officer in David  Petraeus.Meanwhile, Trump has chosen Rep. Tom Price, R-Ga., an orthopedic surgeon who hasbeen one of Capitol Hill's fiercest critics of President Obama's health carelaw, to be secretary of health and human services, a person briefed on thedecision confirmed Monday night.The public announcement of Trump's selection of Price, a six-term congressmanwho chairs the House Budget Committee and is regarded as a policy wonk, isexpected to be made as early as Tuesday.As HHS secretary, Price would become the Trump administration's point person ondismantling and replacing the Affordable Care Act, one of Trump's major campaignpromises.For secretary of state, Trump is looking for assurances that Romney, the 2012Republican presidential nominee who has championed a muscular and at timesinterventionist foreign policy, could be trusted to defend and promote Trump'smarkedly different worldview in capitals around the globe, the people familiarwith the president-elect's deliberations said.Giuliani has openly campaigned for the job and has told friends that he islikely to get it. But Trump's team has determined that it may be challenging andeven unlikely for Giuliani to win Senate confirmation: His web of internationalbusiness interests and the millions of dollars he has earned in paid speechesand consulting work for foreign entities would come under scrutiny, while Sen.Rand Paul, one of 10 Republicans on the Foreign Relations Committee, hasthreatened to block Giuliani's nomination.Romney and Giuliani have been seen as co-favorites to lead the State Department,but Trump this week is expanding his search to include other candidates, chiefamong them Petraeus, a retired Army general and former CIA director.Transition officials said Trump has long admired Petraeus and described hiscandidacy as formidable, despite the baggage he would carry into anyconfirmation battle because of his 2015 conviction for mishandling classifiedinformation. Petraeus' public service career came to an end amid revelationsthat he had an affair with his biographer, Paula Broadwell, and sharedclassified information with her.Petraeus and Trump met Monday afternoon in New York for about an hour, with VicePresident-elect Mike Pence joining them for part of the session. As the generalexited Trump Tower following their session, he praised Trump, telling reportersthat he "showed a great grasp of a variety of the challenges that are out thereand some of the opportunities as well. Very good conversation."Trump later tweeted, "Just met with General Petraeus - was very impressed!"Trump will meet Tuesday with Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., who officials said couldemerge as a candidate, although the senator has said that he is unlikely to endup in serious contention. As chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee,Corker would oversee the confirmation process of Trump's nominee.The nascent Trump transition has been riven by infighting over the possiblenomination of Romney, who is seen as the quintessential establishment figure andwho spoke out against Trump's candidacy in harsh and personal terms.Pence and some Trump advisers are said to have argued that Romney would be asteady hand prepared to help shape relationships around the world. Trump is saidto have buried the hatchet with Romney at their Nov. 19 meeting and sees apolitical benefit to bringing him into the administration: silencing a rivalRepublican who has a big microphone and a network of wealthy donors.But other Trump intimates have advocated forcefully for Giuliani, a trustedloyalist and  Trump defender who developed a close bond with the candidate andis more ideologically in sync with him.The feud spilled into the open over Thanksgiving weekend as Kellyanne Conway,Trump's former campaign manager and now a senior adviser, attacked Romney'scredentials and trustworthiness in a trio of Sunday television appearances.
