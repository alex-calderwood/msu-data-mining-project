HIGHLIGHT:Â A woman weeps during a candlelight vigil last Wednesday after HillaryClinton's loss in the presidential election, on Pennsylvania Avenue outside theWhite House.MICHAEL REYNOLDS/EPALOS ANGELES - When Hillary Clinton lost her White House bid, it was a jaggedexclamation mark punctuating several painful years for Democrats.Come January, the party will have at least 11 fewer U.S. senators, 63 fewerHouse seats and 12 fewer governors than when President Barack Obama took officein 2009.Nationally, there will be about 800 fewer Democratic state lawmakers.By some benchmarks - the control of state capitols, for instance - theDemocratic Party is in worse shape than it has been in more than a century.But Democrats, after several periods of exile from the White House, are nostrangers to the political wilderness - nor fractious infighting over how tofind their way back.The most immediate battle is for leadership of the Democratic NationalCommittee. The contest will pit Washington insiders against Beltway outsiders,liberal backers of Bernie Sanders against more centrist Hillary Clintonholdovers, and advocates of a full-time chairman versus those who feel it isfine to hold another job as well - even serving in Congress.Several contestants have emerged, including Howard Dean, the former Vermontgovernor who ran the national party in the run-up to Obama's 2008 election, andRep. Keith Ellison of Minnesota, a favorite of Sanders and the incoming SenateDemocratic leader, Charles  Schumer of New York.The vote will take place sometime after President-elect Donald Trump'sinauguration Jan. 20.The broader fight grows out of Clinton's stunning defeat. Few will loudlycriticize Obama for having failed to strengthen the party, or lay down a firmerfoundation, during eight years as Democrat in chief.Instead of expanding the political map against Trump into the Republican-leaningreaches of Arizona and Georgia, Democrats are reckoning with the loss ofMichigan and Pennsylvania, states they won in the last six elections, andWisconsin, which had not voted for a Republican for president since 1984."How does the party come back? That's the million-dollar question," said JillHanauer, a longtime Democratic strategist who has focused on expanding the Obamacoalition of minorities and young voters into swing  states."If anyone thinks they can answer that today, don't listen. It's just begun."The last time the party faced such deep existential angst, after three straightlosing presidential campaigns, Democrats shifted their philosophical course andmoved closer to the middle, nudged by a fresh-faced Arkansas governor named BillClinton.Paul Begala, who helped Clinton win the White House in 1992 and worked this yearfor a political action committee backing his wife for president, acknowledged itwas time for a new set of Democratic leaders to emerge.That said, he suggested the party's message should be a throwback to the onethat helped elect Bill Clinton in a time of similar voter anxiety andfrustration: "It's still the economy, stupid," Begala said."If Democrats can't speak to the pain of poor people and working-class people" -whether in Appalachia or the inner cities - "then we don't deserve to be aparty," Begala said.But Cornell Belcher, a Democratic pollster who specializes in African-Americanvoters, warned against focusing too much on the proverbial angry white male whohelped deliver Trump's upset victory."It's hard for me, making a cold calculation, to understand why we spend evenmore money and even more effort going after an increasingly resistant, shrinkingmarketplace," Belcher said."If we expand the electorate, we have a majority. That's where the future is."Beyond the ideological argument, Democrats are also talking about the process.After past setbacks, the party overhauled its presidential nominating system andchanged the political calendar, ideas being floated once more.Supporters of Sanders and former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, who ran againstClinton in the primaries, are still furious at the favoritism shown by theDemocratic National Committee and insist on reducing the influence of "superdelegates.""There is no doubt the Democratic Party would have been stronger in 2016 if wehad a field of seven to 10 strong candidates - senators, governors, mayors - whowere actively debating the future of our country," said Lis Smith, who helpedmanage O'Malley's campaign."We need to open up the whole party, not make this a cabal of insiders who arenostalgic for names from the past."mark.barabak@latimes.com
