Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand is already reaching out to top Hillary Clinton donorsabout the 2020 presidential race. Sources tell us that the New York senator hasbeen personally making calls to some of Clinton's biggest backers to "talk aboutthe direction of the country."One source said, "She isn't directly asking donors about her chances in 2020,but it is implied." However, while Gillibrand has close ties to Clinton'spolitical network, the move hasn't gone down well with some Clinton supporters."Many of us are still grieving. It's like going after the widow at a funeral." Aspokesperson for Gillibrand didn't get back to us. If she were to run, it couldset up an interesting clash of New Yorkers for the Democratic nomination. Gov.Andrew Cuomo has already made it clear he wants to make a run for the WhiteHouse. Other names in the frame include New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, former SanAntonio Mayor  Juli√°n Castro and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. On theRepublican side, if Donald Trump doesn't run for a second term, there are 2020rumors about Rep. Paul Ryan, Sen. Marco Rubio and Sen. Ted Cruz. And, since thepublic loves an outsider, let's not forget Kanye West. After announcing hisintention to run at the VMAs last year, he explained to Britain's BBC Radio 1,"When I talk about the idea of being president, I'm not saying I have anypolitical views." He added, "I don't have views on politics, I just have a viewon humanity, on people, on the truth. If there is anything that I can do with mytime and my day to somehow make a difference while I'm alive, I'm going to tryto do it." Then, Melania Trump wouldn't be the only first lady to have posednude.
