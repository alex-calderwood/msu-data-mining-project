Trump wrote on Twitter.And Petraeus had warm words in return as he left the meeting."I was with him for about an hour. He basically walked us around the world,"said Petraeus, who earned acclaim for leading troop surges in Iraq andAfghanistan. "Showed a great grasp of a variety of the challenges that are outthere and some of the opportunities as well. Very good conversation and we'llsee where it goes from here."While Petraeus remained the preferred choice for secretary of state among someprominent Republicans - including Arizona Sen. John McCain - 2012 GOPpresidential candidate Mitt Romney and Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) are still inthe running and will meet with Trump on Tuesday.Rudy Giuliani and hawkish ex-UN Ambassador John Bolton also were beingconsidered.Petraeus quit the top CIA post in November 2012 after his extramarital affairwith his biographer, Paula Broadwell, went public.He remained under FBI investigation and kept a low profile until March 2015,when he got a sweetheart plea deal with the feds in which he admitted to leakingclassified material to Broadwell and lying to the FBI about it.The following month, a federal judge sentenced him to two years' probation plusa fine of $100,000.Trump was "inclined" to pick Petraeus, a source told Bloomberg News, despite thesecurity breach - though he railed against Hillary Clinton for exposingclassified material through her use of a private e-mail server as secretary ofstate.
