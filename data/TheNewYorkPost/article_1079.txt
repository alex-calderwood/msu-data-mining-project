But let me tell you,whatever our disagreements may be, I've come here to say: We must put them asidefor the good of our country. And we must unite around the candidate who candefeat a dangerous demagogue," Bloomberg said.Trump responded on Twitter by taking a poke at the former mayor's size,dismissing him as "little Michael Bloomberg."Bloomberg aides declined to comment on the conversation.
