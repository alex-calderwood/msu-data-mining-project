They're ba-ack!After falling out of favor in Washington, DC, in the nearly 10-year stretchfollowing the bursting of the housing bubble, Goldman Sachs is poised for aremarkable comeback to the corridors of power.The latest and most significant appointment - ex-partner Steve Mnuchin asTreasury secretary - puts two former execs of the powerhouse bank inPresident-elect Donald Trump's inner circle, poised to formulate the country'sfiscal policy.Onetime Goldman Vice President Stephen Bannon was previously named Trump's chiefstrategist.What's more, Gary Cohn, the current No. 2 under Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein(inset), is seen to be the top choice for budget chief, which would furthercement the bank's return to the center of the nation's financialdecision-making.In addition, Anthony Scaramucci, one of Trump's transition advisers, cut histeeth at Goldman.What makes the comeback even more startling is that just over three weeks ago,Wall Street's smart money had Hillary Clinton winning - and Goldman relegated tothe sidelines for at least another four years after spending eight years in thedesert during the Obama administration."This just would not have happened if Hillary was elected," said one Goldmansource, noting that she was criticized for making too much money from the bankin paid speeches."Given the campaign rhetoric, [the bank's return to power] is very ironic," thesource said.During one Republican presidential primary debate, Trump attacked both rival TedCruz, whose wife was a Goldman managing director, and his future generalelection opponent, Clinton, as pawns of the firm.A company spokesman said the bank "has encouraged its employees to give back tothe community while they are working here and after they leave. We are proudthat many have gone on to serve their country."Lawyer Richard Farley, co-author of "Wall Street Wars: The Epic Battles WithWashington that Created the Modern Financial System," said presidents often turnto Wall Street execs for Treasury secretary because they are among the only oneswho really understand the global economy."I think just understanding the plumbing of the financial system, given howcomplicated it is, makes it almost necessary to have someone who understandsit."The choice of a Goldman alum for Treasury boss did not sit well with everyone."It's a horrid appointment," President Reagan's former Office of Management andBudget Director David Stockman told The Post."We don't need another plenipotentiary from Goldman Sachs and crony capitalistspeculator who made billions off the backs of taxpayers," he said.The last big White House appointment for Goldman occurred in 2006 when PresidentGeorge W. Bush named Goldman chief Hank Paulson his Treasury secretary, whilePresident Clinton named Goldman co-Chair Bob Rubin to that top job in 1995.jkosman@nypost.com
