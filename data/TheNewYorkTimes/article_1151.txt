HIGHLIGHT: François Fillon's promises to limit immigration and protectconservative values in France have helped propel him to the front of thepresidential field.CHASSIEU, France - A patriotic sea of supporters, waving red, white and blueflags, greeted the newly ascendant presidential hopeful François Fillon thisweek at a soulless conference center in this suburb of Lyon.Mr. Fillon described radical Islam as a "totalitarianism like the Nazis" to thecheers of an enthusiastic crowd, adding that France would need Russia's help tofight it. Catholics, Protestants and Jews "don't denounce the values of theRepublic," he thundered - unlike the faithful of a certain other religion."We've got to reduce immigration to its strict minimum," he said. "Our countryis not a sum of communities, it is an identity!"In a year when nativist politics have become the ticket to electoral victory,Mr. Fillon, 62, a dark-suited, stern-faced former prime minister has managed tosuccessfully ride the same nationalist and xenophobic currents as that havepushed politicians in Britain and the United States to victory.For months, Mr. Fillon polled third and even fourth among presidentialcontenders in France and was largely dismissed. But his defense of French valuesand identity has suddenly made him the front-runner as France's right-centerRepublican Party prepares to vote Sunday in a runoff to choose itsstandard-bearer in the 2017 elections - and quite possibly the next president ofFrance.That strategy has not only vaulted Mr. Fillon to the front of the pack,surprising the French news media, pundits and politicians. It has also hasshifted the playing field for French conservatives far to the right, snugalongside the far-right National Front, led by Marine Le Pen, who may be hisstrongest challenger next year.The two are now competing for some of the same voters, but the xenophobic,anti-immigrant National Front is not regarded as respectable by manymiddle-class French people, particularly Catholics.Mr. Fillon, on the other hand, has positioned himself as a staunch defender ofFrench values, vowing to restore authority, honor the Roman Catholic Church andexert "strict administrative control" over Islam.Such appeals were met with fervent cheers during his campaign rally here bysupporters who agreed that French identity and French values were under threatfrom both Islam and the secular left.If those themes sound familiar to the ones that already shaped pivotal votes inBritain and the United States this year, it is because they are. And Mr. Fillon,an unsmiling political veteran, has used them to remarkable effect in France tochange his political fortunes.Few analysts give France's Socialists and their unpopular president, FrançoisHollande, a strong chance in the spring. But Mr. Fillon, with his dark-eyedfrown, suggests a return to authority, and the rally crowd of about 5,000 hereloved it."He really respects French values, and that is very, very important to us," saidVincent Robert, a man in late middle-age who said he was a retired artisan."There is uprightness and frankness," Mr. Robert said. "And incredibleenthusiasm for him in the middle class."His friend Bruno Perrin, a retired management consultant, was equally in thrall."It's his defense of values - Christianity, the family, our traditions - that iswhat we like," he said.Mr. Fillon's supporters say he is now the candidate best placed to bar Ms. LePen's path to victory.Analysts, however, warn that Mr. Fillon's proposed austerity cure for France'seconomic stagnation - cutting 500,000 Civil Service positions and 100 billioneuros (about $105 billion) in spending - could be just the thing to pushfrightened voters into the arms of the National Front leader.Still, parishioners at Paris's solidly bourgeois Sainte-Trinité church, ahulking 19th-century neo-Renaissance monument that looms over a busy square,were in no doubt that Mr. Fillon was the one."He's got a sense of honesty and the family," said one churchgoer, CécileDespointes, after midday Mass this week. "A man of courage and perseverance."It is a surprising turnabout for Mr. Fillon, who just weeks ago was best knownas the unsuccessful prime minister from 2007-2012 of a failed French president,Nicolas Sarkozy, who mocked him behind his back."Courage, Fillon!" Mr. Sarkozy would say derisively, Patrick Buisson, afar-right journalist and one-time adviser to Mr. Sarkozy, wrote in his recentbook "The People's Cause."Then, Mr. Fillon trumped both Mr. Sarkozy - humiliating him in Sunday's round ofvoting - and the pollsters.He came out on top in 87 of France's 101 départements, or districts, with 44percent of the vote, 16 points ahead of the rival he faces Sunday, anotherformer prime minister, Alain Juppé. Mr. Fillon won in Paris and in rural France.Mr. Juppé's more moderate agenda - fewer cuts in the Civil Service and publicspending, less accommodation of Russia, friendlier to gay couples - attractedleft-leaning voters, which in turn disturbed the right's traditional electorate."It bothered me that so many people on the left voted for him," Michel Carron, arural official who attended the rally here, said of Mr. Juppé.Mr. Fillon "defends our values," he said. "We're in a sort of despair, and hemakes us live," Mr. Carron said, adding that he knows National Frontsympathizers who voted for him.As in the United States, the pollsters had failed to detect a hidden yearningfor the restoration of a mythical older France, rural and dominated by thevalues of a conservative Roman Catholic Church."The media, television, they are out of phase with the population, which is fedup with being called xenophobic and racist," said Ms. Despointes, after Massoutside Sainte-Trinité in Paris.Mr. Fillon is not keen on social changes like same-sex marriage and chafes atbeing the "vassal" of America, as he put it in his speech here. The crowd at therally was almost all white."He'll help us to find our identity again," said Jacqueline Badoux, a retiredteacher who attended the rally."In the fight against Islamic State, he will have the authority," said Ms.Badoux's husband, Bernard, also a retired teacher, who approved mightily of Mr.Fillon's performance here.The very qualities the mercurial big-city Mr. Sarkozy made fun of, according toMr. Buisson - Mr. Fillon's rural origins and ponderousness, "his legendarycaution and his silences" - earned him favor with the crowd here."This country is the daughter of Christianity, as well as the Enlightenment,"Mr. Fillon told the crowd outside Lyon. "I will put the family back at the heartof all public policy." The crowd roared.Catholics are gravitating toward him because "for the essential values - family,nation, identity - Fillon incarnates them with a certain tranquillity," said theRev. Pierre-Hervé Grosjean, a Versailles priest who writes an influentialCatholic blog."There's a desire to break with the spirit of May '68 and go back to the valuesof family and education, to a France that is not ashamed of its roots," saidFather Grosjean, referring to a period when thousands of demonstrators took tothe streets protesting France's old-world order. For Catholics, "he capturesthis alliance between conviction and realism," he said.At the rally, Mr. Fillon promised to bring back school uniforms, restore respectin schools and stand up to America.Mr. Fillon is reminiscent of President-elect Donald J. Trump in a significantway: He is friendlier toward Russia and its leader, Vladimir V. Putin.Indeed, the French news media has detailed his numerous ties to Mr. Putin - hehas stayed at Mr. Putin's residence at Sochi, according to the newspaper LeMonde, and played billiards with him.He even received a bottle of wine from the Russian leader on the death of hismother, according tothe newsmagazine L'Express, which described Mr. Fillon asthe French politician who "appreciates" Mr. Putin the most.Such concerns, it appears, did little to damage Mr. Trump's candidacy in theUnited States. Similarly, they may be just as easy to overlook for supporters ofMr. Fillon like Ms. Despointes."He's a man of conviction," she said outside Sainte-Trinité. "For people whohave moral values."PHOTO: François Fillon at a rally in Paris on Friday.
