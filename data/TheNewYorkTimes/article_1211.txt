HIGHLIGHT: As Mr. Trump fills his cabinet with people of wealth and power, he isrekindling animosity between his anti-establishment supporters and moretraditional Republicans.WASHINGTON - As President-elect Donald J. Trump fills his cabinet with people ofwealth and power, he is rekindling animosity between his anti-establishmentsupporters and more traditional Republicans, a rift that could test theendurance of his new political coalition.Some supporters, including those closest to Mr. Trump, are warning him thatafter running for president as a disrupter of the political and ruling classes,he risks charges of hypocrisy by bringing into his administration the kinds ofpeople he vowed to drive out of Washington."It's a delicate dance," said Tony Perkins, the president of the Family ResearchCouncil. Mr. Perkins added that no one fully knew what to expect from the newpresident or his cabinet, or what the role of the conservative movement would befor the next four years."Part of this is just establishing what those relationships and those boundariesare going to be like," he said. "It's imperative that the Trump administrationwalks in lock step with the Trump campaign in terms of how their policies matchtheir promises."Those expressing unease with Mr. Trump's appointments, or potentialappointments, include two factions on the right. There are the traditionalconservatives, like Mr. Perkins, who would prefer hard-liners and areparticularly unhappy that Mitt Romney is being considered as secretary of state.And there are the nationalists who are chiefly focused on immigration and tradeand recoil at the prospect of Mr. Trump's being surrounded by Wall Streetfigures.Mr. Trump announced on Tuesday that he would nominate Elaine L. Chao - a cabinetsecretary under President George W. Bush, a member of many corporate boards, andthe wife of the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell - to be histransportation secretary. On Wednesday morning, his picks were Wilbur Ross, thebillionaire investor, for commerce secretary and Todd Ricketts, an owner of theChicago Cubs and one of the president-elect's most important fund-raisers, asdeputy commerce secretary.Then, to lead the Treasury Department, Mr. Trump named Steven Mnuchin, a formerbanker at Goldman Sachs, the Wall Street firm he pilloried during his campaignas the epitome of a rigged financial system. During the Republican primarycontest, Mr. Trump repeatedly brought up the fact that Heidi Cruz, the wife ofone of his rivals, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, worked for Goldman.The apparent contradictions do not seem to bother others on Mr. Trump's team.Stephen K. Bannon, the president-elect's chief strategist and the strongestpopulist voice among his advisers, is himself a wealthy former Goldman Sachsbanker and has been supportive of elevating Mr. Mnuchin and Mr. Ross, whom hesees as Washington outsiders like him.But the right-wing writer and filmmaker Mike Cernovich was not so sanguine -especially about Mr. Mnuchin, who not only has a stint at Goldman Sachs on hisrésumé but also once worked for George Soros, the billionaire financier whocontributes to myriad liberal causes."Trump's Treasury Secretary is former Goldman Sachs, former Soros employee," Mr.Cernovich wrote on Twitter. "WTF is going on at @transition2017?""It's 'make the establishment and Goldman Sachs great again,'" said Mark Levin,a conservative talk radio host. "This is not Trump draining the swamp. This isthe swamp draining Trump."Others, while uneasy, expressed cautious hope that the officials would onlycarry out the populist platform Mr. Trump ran to victory on last month."As long as they effectively implement and advocate for the Trump agenda, allthis criticism will fade away," said Laura Ingraham, the conservative radiohost.For some conservatives, Mr. Trump's decision to reach out to Mr. Romney as apossible secretary of state has been even more puzzling. The onetime head of aprivate equity firm, Mr. Romney was branded by his fellow Republicans, as wellas Democrats, as a symbol of Wall Street during his losing 2012 presidentialcampaign. Especially after his criticism of Mr. Trump this year, he is seen asthe quintessential member of the Republican establishment.Newt Gingrich, a former House speaker and a confidant of Mr. Trump's, mocked thescene on Tuesday between the president-elect and Mr. Romney: a sit-down overfrog legs and diver scallops at a Manhattan restaurant."I'm sure, at an elegant three-star restaurant in New York, that Mitt was fullyat home, happy to share his vision of populism," Mr. Gingrich said on Ms.Ingraham's program. "Every day this hangs out there," he said, "it's harder andmore expensive to pick Romney."The fight over Mr. Trump's cabinet raises the same essential questions of how toadvance conservatism that split Republicans for the better part of the lastdecade: whether the party was too compromising on its core principles, toosensitive to shifting demographics and too timid to nominate a hard-line truebeliever. Now that Mr. Trump has won and shattered those conventions, themessage from some of the people who feel the Republican Party turned its back onhim is unforgiving."Trump came in and slayed the dragon," said Richard Viguerie, a veteranconservative activist and agitator against the party establishment. "And nowhe's going to go back and breathe life into this dragon that voters rejected? Itjust doesn't make any sense to us."Mr. Viguerie likened a Romney appointment to President Ronald Reagan's namingGeorge Bush as his running mate in 1980, a decision that many conservativesstill look back on with regret, given the relatively centrist agenda Mr. Bushwould pursue during his own term as president. "Romney would basically be aTrojan horse," he said.Other conservatives are equally incredulous about the idea of nominating Mr.Romney. "A slap in the face," said L. Brent Bozell, the founder of the MediaResearch Center, a conservative group that critiques the news media. David Lane,a prominent Christian conservative, said it would be "disastrous for theRepublican Party." Representative Chris Collins of New York said it made littlesense for Mr. Trump to appoint a "self-serving egomaniac" like Mr. Romney.Though Mr. Romney remains under serious consideration for the secretary of statejob, Mr. Trump and his team are sensitive to the appearance of hypocrisy and areworking to maintain the "blue-collar billionaire" image that he nurtured withworking-class voters.On Thursday, Mr. Trump returned to the Rust Belt region that helped deliver theWhite House to him. He stopped first at an air conditioning factory in Indianato announce an agreement that he said would prevent jobs from leaving thecountry, and then headed to Cincinnati for the first stop on what he calls athank-you tour, which is planned as a series of campaign-style rallies.But it is not clear how much his supporters will ultimately care who ends up inthe cabinet. His political base has been a forgiving bunch, rarely punishing himfor contradictions and backtracking that would hurt other politicians.Even Mr. Collins conceded that Mr. Trump essentially had carte blanche. "I thinkthey trust, implicitly trust, Donald Trump to make his campaign promises areality," he said.Get politics and Washington news updates via Facebook, Twitter and in theMorning Briefing newsletter.Jonathan Martin contributed reporting.PHOTO: Mitt Romney after dining with President-elect Donald J.
