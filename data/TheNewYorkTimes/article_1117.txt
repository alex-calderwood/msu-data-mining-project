HIGHLIGHT: Physicians for Human Rights discusses Donald Trump's stated supportof torture, and a former Army psychiatrist writes about medical ethics.To the Editor:Re "Even Nightmares Are Classified" ("Lasting Scars" series, front page, Nov.13):Your reporting reminds us all of the indelible scars the United States tortureprogram has left on its victims. During the Obama administration, we in thehuman rights and medical communities held out hope for transparency andaccountability about the appalling treatment of detainees; instead, we've had torely on investigative journalists and detainees themselves to get a fullaccounting of torture's lasting effects on both body and mind.With a Trump presidency now on the horizon, there's a real fear that the UnitedStates could descend back into the bleak days when medieval, barbarous practiceslike waterboarding were greenlit at the highest levels of government. Thisspring, Donald Trump said of waterboarding: "I love waterboarding. I think it'sgreat."Waterboarding and other forms of torture are violations of United States andinternational law, and are fundamentally at odds with long-establishedinternational standards.As physicians and medical professionals, we'll be watching closely to seewhether or not Mr. Trump carries through on his campaign promises of bringingback torture. If so, we'll be ready to fight him at every step.DONNA McKAYExecutive DirectorPhysicians for Human RightsNew YorkTo the Editor:Your indictment against the United States government, military medicine andmilitary mental health, and even civilian psychiatry for its lack of oversight,is exquisite. At the very least, your exposé suggests a new low for theinstitutional abuse of psychiatry in the United States military.The tormented accounts by the psychiatrists and others who expressed feelingtorn between prisoner-patients, who suspected that the psychiatrists wereaccomplices in torture, and interrogators, who accused psychiatrists ofprotecting the prisoner-patients, are reminiscent of many of the responses Ireceived from former Army psychiatrists in a post-Vietnam War study.Those psychiatrists who served after 1968 and after America repudiated the warwere typically bitter, disillusioned and deeply regretful because, while by thenmost were against the war and earnestly sought to reduce psychiatric suffering,their soldier-patients nonetheless opposed treatment as if they were agents of apersecuting military.It was a rich and troubling example of ethical tensions arising from so-calleddual agency.But this was not the case for the psychiatrists at Guantánamo, at least by thestandards of the American Psychiatric Association. In 2006, the A.P.A.officially "reiterated" its position that psychiatrists' primary obligation isto prisoner-patients, including serving as their advocate. They are furthermoreprohibited from participating in or facilitating torture and are obligated toreport evidence of torture to those in a position to take corrective action.But what's especially suggested by the article is that in being subordinates inthe military hierarchy, the psychiatrists in Guantánamo were not confident as tohow to oppose institutional pressure that they know which "side" they were onand act accordingly.In 1993, I openly advocated that the A.P.A. actively monitor the regulations,policies and treatment doctrine affecting psychiatrists in the uniformedservices, but to no avail. The circumstances in Guantánamo suggest that thisshould be seriously reconsidered.Otherwise, there remains, as was the case in Vietnam, an unreasonable burden ofconscience borne alone by each psychiatrist who serves.NORMAN M.
