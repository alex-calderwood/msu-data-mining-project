Two students were disciplined for telling black students boarding a busthat they should sit in the back.Swastikas were drawn in a boys' bathroom at a middle school in Bethesda, Md.,which has many Jewish students. Children all over the country, particularlyLatinos and Muslims, have fearfully asked teachers and guidance counselorswhether they and their families will be deported.The Southern Poverty Law Center, which has been tracking thousands of suchepisodes since the election, said the most commonly reported locations forharassment were K-12 schools."It's impossible to wall schools off from the rest of society," said MaureenCostello, the director of Teaching Tolerance, a program of the law center.
