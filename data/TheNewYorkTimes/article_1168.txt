HIGHLIGHT: Mr. Fillon, a former prime minister who pledged to limit immigrationand control Islam, handily defeated Alain Juppé in a Republican Party runoff.PARIS - French voters chose a socially conservative, budget-cutting former primeminister on Sunday to lead the center-right Republican Party in next year'spresidential election. Once again, the outcome upset pollsters' initialpredictions, and it paved the way for a likely face-off with the country'sfar-right party in 2017.François Fillon, 62, a sober, dark-suited government veteran who called foreconomic sacrifice, major changes in the French workplace and a crackdown onimmigration and Islam, won about 67 percent of the vote in the primary conteston Sunday, crushing his more centrist opponent, Alain Juppé, who is also aformer prime minister.French presidential elections are usually decided in two rounds, with the firstround winnowing the field to two candidates. Having won his party's primary, Mr.Fillon is widely expected to be one of those two finalists in the generalelection in the spring.It now seems increasingly unlikely that the current governing party, theSocialists, will produce the other. The French left is weak and in disarrayafter five years in which high unemployment rates and slow economic growth havebarely budged. President François Hollande has not said whether he will run foranother term, and many in his party hope he does not.Instead, the second contender is widely expected to be Marine Le Pen of thefar-right National Front. Her party has never been able to attract the backingof more than about one-third of France's electorate, and for now at least, fewanalysts predict that it can win the presidency next year. But the xenophobic,anti-immigrant party has received a new lift from the triumph of President-electDonald J. Trump in the United States.Mr. Fillon, with his themes of restoring France's identity and nationalgreatness and his tough language on immigrants and Islam, has been making aclear play for Ms. Le Pen's voters.His promise to slash 500,000 government jobs and cut the budget by more than 100billion euros (about $106 billion) could leave him vulnerable against Ms. LePen, who promises to safeguard France's substantial safety net of governmentprotections and spending. Mr. Fillon told supporters during the campaign that hewas going to "break down the house," but many in France don't want the housebroken.Promises of top-to-bottom economic overhaul have generally brought thousands ofdemonstrators into the streets. Unions are already sounding warnings about Mr.Fillon's plans to reduce the state's role in the economy, and the National Fronthas heaped scorn on his proposals.In his victory speech on Sunday night, Mr. Fillon emphasized traditional Frenchrightist themes of restoring "authority" and "French values," as he didthroughout the campaign, when commentators largely dismissed his chances."In our country, there is an immense need for respect and pride," Mr. Fillontold cheering supporters in Paris. "There is also a demand for the authority ofthe state, and for exemplary behavior from those who govern it. In my conduct,the voters of the right and the center have found the French values to whichthey are so much attached."His opponent, Mr. Juppé, campaigned on a "unity" theme that led many on theright to suggest that he was a leftist in disguise. The notes Mr. Fillon soundedwere darker.With many of his fellow citizens uneasy over immigration, terrorist attacks andthe integration of Muslims, Mr. Fillon vowed to restore a more traditionalFrance by strictly regulating Islam and limiting immigration, and promised analliance with Russia to crush what he called "totalitarian" Islamists.Commentators have noted Mr. Fillon's close relations with Vladimir V. Putin,Russia's president.Mr. Fillon served as an overshadowed prime minister when Nicolas Sarkozy waspresident from 2007-12. In the first round of voting on Nov. 20, he crushed hisformer boss, who had regularly humiliated him.A Catholic from conservative, rural western France, Mr. Fillon enteredParliament in 1981; at 27, he was the house's youngest member. Catholic voterswho appreciated his positions against abortion and same-sex marriage supportedhim heavily in the presidential race, even though he has promised not tointerfere with legal guarantees of either.Mr. Fillon still sits in the National Assembly and lives in a medieval manorhouse near Le Mans with his family; he has five children. During the campaign,he spoke often of France's identity and of instilling the country's "nationalepic" in its schools."France can't tolerate its slippage," Mr. Fillon told supporters on Sundaynight. "France wants truth and action. This past presidential term has beenpathetic. We've got to end it and start afresh, as we haven't done in over 30years."Mr. Fillon has promised to rewrite France's 3,000-page labor code, reduce taxeson companies and the rich, raise the retirement age to 65, and lengthen the35-hour standard workweek. He called his program "more radical, maybe moredifficult," in a televised debate with Mr. Juppé last week."I could have said more agreeable things," Mr. Fillon said. "But the only way tokeep one's promises is to have a very precise program."His supporters do not appear to be scared by these promises, at least for now."He's an upright man," said Roselyne Duchaine, 81, a retiree in Paris's 17tharrondissement who said she had voted for Mr. Fillon on Sunday.Another voter, Thierry Roland, 68, said: "Fillon has the rigor. He shows hishand."Benoît Morenne contributed reporting.PHOTO: François Fillon, a former prime minister, in Paris on Sunday, when hehandily defeated Alain Juppé in a primary runoff.
