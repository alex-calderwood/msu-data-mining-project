HIGHLIGHT: The move represents a continued march back from standards set in 2009and complicates the president-elect's pledge to eliminate influence from specialinterests.WASHINGTON - President-elect Donald J. Trump will allow corporations and wealthyindividuals to make large donations to fund the activities surrounding hisinauguration, complicating his promise to eliminate special interests frominfluencing his government.Mr. Trump plans to ban money from registered lobbyists, whom he has purged fromhis transition team and barred from working for his administration. But therestrictions will be lighter on corporations and individuals - the groups thathave traditionally provided a vast majority of funding for the festivitiessurrounding the transfer of power.The restrictions, which members of the Presidential Inaugural Committeecautioned have yet to be finalized, represent a continued march back fromstandards set in 2009, when President-elect Barack Obama banned gifts fromlobbyists, political action committees and corporations, and put a cap of$50,000 on individuals.Mr. Obama relaxed his own rules in 2012, after what was then the most expensivepresidential campaign in history had depleted his donor base, lifting the ban oncorporate gifts and restrictions on the size of those from individuals.Mr. Trump, who like Mr. Obama campaigned on reducing the influence of money inpolitics, appears poised to relax them further.Officials planning the inauguration said Mr. Trump would solicit corporatedonations up to $1 million and allow money to be transferred from politicalaction committees on a case-by-case basis. The inaugural committee has notreached a decision on where to cap gifts from individuals, if at all.All told, Mr. Trump hopes to raise roughly $65 million to $75 million to fundthe parade, balls and other festivities surrounding his swearing-in aspresident, according to several people involved in the planning efforts.Such a fund-raising total, if it materializes, would easily surpass the $43million Mr. Obama's team raised for his 2013 inauguration and the $53 million, arecord, that it raised for his first inauguration in 2009.Thomas Barrack Jr., a private equity investor who is heading the committeeresponsible for planning the events surrounding Mr. Trump's inauguration on Jan.20, said the decision to limit donations from certain groups was "in line withthe president-elect's thoughts on ethics reform."But campaign finance experts said the restrictions left much to be desired,targeting groups that traditionally provide little funding for the occasionwhile seemingly letting bigger donors - including corporate interests that Mr.Trump took aim at on the campaign trail - off the hook."For the most part, they are illusory, because they are restricting money thatdoesn't really play any significant role in funding the inauguration," said FredWertheimer, a longtime advocate of campaign finance overhaul, referring to therestrictions on lobbyists and foreign interests.The corporate and individual money that does traditionally play a significantrole, he added, would be allowed to flow more or less unabated, leaving thepotential of undue influence in place."You can't have a more ideal opportunity to buy influence and ingratiateyourself with a new administration than by giving a huge contribution to pay fortheir inauguration," Mr. Wertheimer said.Bob Biersack, a senior fellow at the Center for Responsive Politics, was moreforgiving toward Mr. Trump, but he said it would take a fundamental change inthe way inaugurations were funded to meaningfully root out special interests."I don't find it fundamentally inconsistent with what he is saying," he said. "Ijust think the rhetoric and the reality are different."Presidential transition committees, which coordinate and finance most of thefestivities that surround the federally funded swearing-in ceremony, face few ofthe fund-raising restrictions campaigns do, and their practices vary frompresident to president.President George W. Bush did not restrict who could support his inauguralfestivities, but he put caps on gifts.The committee is still in the early stages of assembling what will be anoperation employing hundreds of people responsible for planning dozens ofevents. As of Wednesday morning, the fund-raising packages that are typicallyused to solicit donations were still being vetted by lawyers, and subcommitteeswere still taking shape to handle issues like security and entertainment."It's like putting on the Olympics in 61 days," Mr. Barrack said, adding thatthe committee was racing to finalize plans by the end of the week.Two people working with the committee said it planned to roll out tiered givingpackages next week, most likely ranging from $25,000 to $1 million, that willreward donors with progressively more access to more intimate events with Mr.Trump and his team. The committee is planning to hold two official balls,according to two people involved in the planning. By comparison, Mr. Obamaattended 10 official balls in 2009.Mr. Trump is not expected to donate to the festivities himself, as he did to thecampaign, according to members of the committee, who spoke on the condition ofanonymity to discuss plans that had not been finalized.Sara Armstrong, a longtime Republican National Committee official who helpedplan the Republican National Convention in Cleveland this summer, has beenappointed chief executive and is leading the team that Mr. Barrack said wouldeventually total 350 people out of an office building just off the NationalMall. As of Wednesday, the committee had hired about 100 people, he said.The committee includes generous donors to Mr. Trump's campaign, like WoodyJohnson, the owner of the New York Jets; Gail Icahn, the wife of the investorCarl Icahn; and the casino magnate Sheldon Adelson and his wife, Miriam. Severalstalwart backers of Republican causes, like Stephen A. Wynn and Lewis M.Eisenberg, are on the committee, as is Brian Ballard, Mr. Trump's longtimeFlorida lobbyist.The overall cost of the inauguration and related festivities is likely to run toas much as $200 million. Most of that burden will fall on taxpayers, though, whofund everything from security to the swearing-in ceremony and inaugural luncheonorganized by a joint committee of Congress.Mr. Trump's team said it was expecting two million to three million people toflood Washington for the ceremony, a crowd that could surpass the 1.8 millionestimated to have been on hand for Mr. Obama's first inauguration, which was arecord. Planners are also expecting more protesters than usual around the event.Mr. Barrack said Mr. Trump had instructed him to plan events tailored to thepolitical moment."It's one of the greatest opportunities that this president has to put hisfingerprints on bridging the divide," Mr. Barrack said on Wednesday.Mike Litterst, a spokesman for the National Park Service, which controls theMall and other public spaces where the inauguration will take place, said onMonday that the Park Service did not expect to meet with officials from thegroup until after Thanksgiving.But across Washington, the physical preparations for Jan. 20 are well underway,even as the city's political establishment is struggling to come to terms withthe election outcome.Capitol architects have been hammering away since September on the more than10,000-square-foot inaugural platform overlooking the Mall. And outside theWhite House, Park Service staff members are at work on the presidentialreviewing stand where Mr. Trump will review his inaugural parade.Get politics and Washington news updates via Facebook, Twitter and in theMorning Briefing newsletter.Maggie Haberman contributed reporting from New York.PHOTO: Workers building the presidential reviewing stand on Tuesday inWashington for the inaugural parade.
