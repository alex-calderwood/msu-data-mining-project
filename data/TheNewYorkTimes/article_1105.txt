HIGHLIGHT: As Democrats pick through the wreckage of the campaign, one lesson isclear: The election was notable as much for the people who did not show up, asfor those who did.Correction AppendedMILWAUKEE - Four barbers and a firefighter were pondering their future under aTrump presidency at the Upper Cutz barbershop last week."We got to figure this out," said Cedric Fleming, one of the barbers. "We got agangster in the chair now," he said, referring to President-elect Donald J.Trump.They admitted that they could not complain too much: Only two of them had voted.But there were no regrets."I don't feel bad," Mr. Fleming said, trimming a mustache. "Milwaukee is tired.Both of them were terrible. They never do anything for us anyway."As Democrats pick through the wreckage of the campaign, one lesson is clear: Theelection was notable as much for the people who did not show up, as for thosewho did. Nationally, about half of eligible voters did not cast ballots.Wisconsin, a state that Hillary Clinton had assumed she would win, historicallyboasts one of the nation's highest rates of voter participation; this year's68.3 percent turnout was the fifth best among the 50 states. But by localstandards, it was a disappointment, the lowest turnout in 16 years. And thoseno-shows were important. Mr. Trump won the state by just 27,000 voters.Milwaukee's lowest-income neighborhoods offer one explanation for the turnoutfigures. Of the city's 15 council districts, the decline in turnout from 2012 to2016 in the five poorest was consistently much greater than the drop seen inmore prosperous areas - accounting for half of the overall decline in turnoutcitywide.The biggest drop was here in District 15, a stretch of fading wooden homes,sandwich shops and fast-food restaurants that is 84 percent black. In thisdistrict, voter turnout declined by 19.5 percent from 2012 figures, according toNeil Albrecht, executive director of the City of Milwaukee Election Commission.It is home to some of Milwaukee's poorest residents and, according to a 2016documentary, "Milwaukee 53206," has one of the nation's highest per-capitaincarceration rates.At Upper Cutz, a bustling barbershop in a green-trimmed wooden house, talk ofpolitics inevitably comes back to one man: Barack Obama. Mr. Obama's electionsinfused many here with a feeling of connection to national politics they hadnever before experienced. But their lives have not gotten appreciably better,and sourness has set in."We went to the beach," said Maanaan Sabir, 38, owner of the Juice Kitchen, abrightly painted shop a few blocks down West North Avenue, using a metaphor todescribe the emotion after Mr. Obama's election. "And then eight yearshappened."All four barbers had voted for Mr. Obama. But only two could muster theenthusiasm to vote this time. And even then, it was a sort of protest. One wrotein Mrs. Clinton's Democratic opponent, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. Theother wrote in himself."I'm so numb," said Jahn Toney, 45, who had written in Mr. Sanders. He said nopresident in his lifetime had done anything to improve the lives of blackpeople, including Mr. Obama, whom he voted for twice. "It's like I should haveknown this would happen. We're worse off than before."But Mr. Obama did do something important: "He did give black people something toaspire to. That's a lot. I'm happy my son was able to see a black president."Mr. Fleming, 47, who has been trimming hair, beards and mustaches for 30 years,had hoped his small business would get easier to run. But it hasn't."Give us loans, or a 401(k)," he said, trimming the mustache of Steve Stricklin,a firefighter from the neighborhood. His biggest issue was health insurance. Mr.Fleming lost his coverage after his divorce three years ago and has struggled tofind a policy he could afford. He finally found one, which starts Monday butcosts too much at $300 a month."Ain't none of this been working," he said. He did not vote.Mr. Albrecht, of the election commission, said other factors contributed to thedecline in turnout. This was the first general election under new state lawsthat required voters to produce an approved photo ID card, and that stiffenedthe requirements for new voters to prove their residence. This was particularlyonerous for the poor, who move often.Mr. Albrecht said he believed this change had cost several thousand people inthe city their vote."To me that's very significant," he said. "It takes away from the fairness andintegrity of the election."Although two federal district courts had ruled that the photo ID lawdiscriminated against African-Americans, who disproportionately lack theapproved IDs, the law was applied on Election Day after an appeals court stayedone of the decisions. Gov. Scott Walker, a Republican who backed the laws, hassaid they have no impact on voter participation, and Mr. Albrecht allowed thattheir effect on Milwaukee's turnout would not have erased Mr. Trump's victory inthe state.Perhaps the biggest drags on voter turnout in Milwaukee, as in the rest of thecountry, were the candidates themselves. To some, it was like having to choosebetween broccoli and liver."I felt cornered," said Ian Pfeiffer, 25, who works the grill at Jake'sDelicatessen and says he did not vote. "We were stuck between Trump and Hillary.They really left us with no choice."Mr. Pfeiffer's grandmother, an avid supporter of Mrs. Clinton, spent monthstrying to convince him to vote for her. But he could not get over his revulsionat what he saw as trust issues related to the Clinton Foundation. (Mr.Pfeiffer's grandfather pushed him toward Mr. Trump, but he found him even lessappealing.)He thought Oprah Winfrey would be a good candidate."Hey, would you vote for Oprah Winfrey?" he said in a loud voice to a line ofcustomers."Yeah, I'd vote for her," said Erin Miles, 41, a financial services workerwaiting for her sandwich. "She has a level head and decision-making skills."Few of the men and women interviewed on West North Street last week had votedfor Mr. Trump, though many said they admired him. (He spoke his mind. He wasrich.)"If I would have voted, I would have voted for him," said Andre Frierson, 40, asecurity guard working the evening shift at Jake's. "From a businessperspective, I loved him."As for Mrs. Clinton, "other countries probably wouldn't have respected usbecause we had a woman running the country," he said.One exception was Justin Babar, who said he voted for Mr. Trump as a protestagainst Mrs. Clinton. He blamed her husband's policies for putting him in prisonfor 20 years.As for the claims of racism that have dogged Mr. Trump, Mr. Babar wasn't soworried. "It's better than smiling to my face but going behind closed doors andvoting against our kids," he said.Tarvus Hawthorne, 45, a program coordinator at a local nonprofit, agreed."He was real, unlike a lot of liberal Democrats who are just as racist" but keepit hidden, he said, his jaw slathered with shaving cream. "You can reason withthem all day long, but they think they know it all. They want to have control.That they know what's best for 'those people.'"Still, he voted for Mrs. Clinton, as did many others here.Upper Cutz gets busier as the day wears on. Children come in after school.Danielle Rogers, Mr. Toney's sister, stopped by the barbershop for a visit.Everybody agreed they would miss Mr. Obama.Ms. Rogers said Mr. Obama had aged a lot. "It's like having a bunch of badkids," she said. "He's probably saying: 'I'm done. Take them back to theirmama's house.'"Mr. Fleming was trying to imagine Mr. Trump as president."The White House is going to be the penthouse!" he said, adding that Mr. Trumpwould be like Al Pacino in "Scarface," with parties in the mansion and exoticanimals roaming around the grounds. "If he comes home and finds his wifecheating on him, he could just say, 'Let's go to war!'"They were laughing. But they were also worried."He's going to mess with us on some racist level," said Otis Jackson, 45, abarber who did not vote. "He's already appointed a known racist," he said,referring to Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump's chief strategist and the former headof Breitbart News, which has been denounced as a white nationalist hate site.With so many people sitting in his chair over the years, Mr. Fleming hasdeveloped a keen sense of where society is headed. But now he is stumped."This was a weird election," he said, holding a set of clippers and lookingpensive. "You can't tell what's on people's minds. There are less cars outthere. No one wants to come out. No one knows what comes next."He added, "Hell, Trump doesn't even know."Follow The New York Times's politics and Washington coverage onFacebookandTwitter, and sign up for theFirst Draft politics newsletter.Michael Wines contributed reporting from New York.Correction: November 23, 2016, WednesdayThis article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article onMonday about a voting district in Milwaukee where many residents did not votemisstated the year of release for the documentary "Milwaukee 53206," whichexamined problems in the same neighborhood.
