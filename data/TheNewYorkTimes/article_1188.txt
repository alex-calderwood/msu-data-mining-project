HIGHLIGHT: Reversing a plan the president-elect had assailed, the company willkeep roughly half of the 2,000 manufacturing jobs in Indiana that it was toshift to Mexico.From the earliest days of his campaign, Donald J. Trump made keepingmanufacturing jobs in the United States his signature economic issue, and thedecision by Carrier, the big air-conditioner company, to move over 2,000 of themfrom Indiana to Mexico was a tailor-made talking point for him on the stump.On Thursday, Mr. Trump and Mike Pence, Indiana's governor and the vicepresident-elect, plan to appear at Carrier's Indianapolis factory to announce adeal with the company to keep roughly 1,000 jobs in the state, according toofficials with the transition team as well as Carrier.Mr. Trump will be hard-pressed to alter the economic forces that have hammeredthe Rust Belt for decades, but forcing Carrier and its parent company, UnitedTechnologies, to reverse course is a powerful tactical strike that will heartenhis followers even before he takes office."I'm ready for him to come," said Robin Maynard, a 24-year veteran of Carrierwho builds high-efficiency furnaces and earns almost $24 an hour. "Now I can putmy daughter through college without having to look for another job."It also signals that Mr. Trump is a different kind of Republican, willing totake on big business, at least in individual cases.Big day on Thursday for Indiana and the great workers of that wonderful state.Wewill keep our companies and jobs in the U.S. Thanks Carrier - Donald J. Trump(@realDonaldTrump) November 30, 2016And just as only a confirmed anti-Communist like Richard Nixon could go toChina, so only a businessman like Mr. Trump could take on corporate Americawithout being called a Bernie Sanders-style socialist. If Barack Obama had triedthe same maneuver, he'd probably have drawn criticism for intervening in thefree market.In exchange for keeping the factory running in Indianapolis, Mr. Trump and Mr.Pence are expected to reiterate their campaign pledges to be friendlier tobusinesses by easing regulations and overhauling the corporate tax code,according to a spokeswoman for Mr. Trump.The state of Indiana also plans to give economic incentives to Carrier as partof the deal to stay, according to local officials.The message from Mr. Trump that captivated the Carrier workers - keepingmanufacturing jobs in the United States after decades of losses to overseasfactories and automation - resonated throughout the Rust Belt. That promise,plus his opposition to pacts like the North American Free Trade Agreement, werekey reasons he was able to edge out Hillary Clinton in states like Pennsylvania,Michigan and Wisconsin.We are pleased to have reached a deal with President-elect Trump & VP-electPence to keep close to 1,000 jobs in Indy. More details soon. - Carrier(@Carrier) November 30, 2016Political symbolism aside, saving 1,000 Carrier jobs doesn't loom so large in aneconomy that's created an average of 181,000 jobs a month this year, noted JaredBernstein, a liberal economist who served as adviser in the Obama administrationfrom 2009 to 2011.Still, he confessed a grudging admiration for Mr. Trump's political jujitsu. "IfI weren't so scared of the damage a Trump administration might do, I'd find itrefreshing to see an administration fighting for factory jobs like this," hesaid. "That said, no one should confuse what Trump is doing here withsustainable economic policy."Over the long term, and for less prominent firms, the temptation to move tocheaper locales for manufacturing will stay great, said Robert Reich, aprominent liberal Democrat who served as secretary of labor in the Clintonadministration."Memories are short but the economic fundamentals remain the same," he said."Wall Street is breathing down companies' necks to cut costs, and the laborsavings in Mexico is too great."Mr. Trump first announced he was talking to Carrier on Thanksgiving Day viaTwitter, which the company quickly confirmed. The discussions have continuedthis week, and with a tentative deal in hand on Tuesday, transition officialsscheduled Mr. Trump's and Mr. Pence's visit to Indianapolis."I didn't think it would be this quick," Mr. Maynard said.While the standoff loomed large in the lives of its employees in Indiana, forUnited Technologies the forgone savings is tiny - equivalent to about 2 centsper share in earnings."Every penny counts, but if we step back and I'm looking at earnings of $6.60per share this year, 2 cents is an easy concession if the president-electlistens to some of the company's bigger concerns," said Howard Rubel, a seniorequity analyst with Jefferies, an investment banking firm in New York.When Carrier announced in February that the two Indiana factories would beclosing, it did offer benefits to employees facing layoffs, including paying forthem to go back to school and retrain for other careers. Even with that,however, once the layoffs were to begin in mid-2017, most of the workers wouldhave had a hard time finding jobs that paid anywhere near the $20 to $25 an hourthat veteran line workers earn.Carrier is best known for its air-conditioners, but it also sells a variety ofother heating and cooling equipment for homes and businesses, like the gasfurnaces and fan coils for electric furnaces made at the Indianapolis factory.The jobs in Indiana Mr. Trump has referred to are in two separate sites - theCarrier plant in Indianapolis, with 1,400 employees, and a United Technologiesfactory in Huntington, Ind., with 700.While Carrier will forfeit some $65 million a year in savings the move wassupposed to generate, that's a small price to pay to avoid the public relationsdamage from moving the jobs as well as a possible threat to United Technologies'far-larger military contracting business.Roughly 10 percent of United Technologies' $56 billion in revenue comes from thefederal government; the Pentagon is its single largest customer. With $4 billionin profit last year, the company has the flexibility to find the savingselsewhere.Members of Congress have been pressing to punish big military contractors ifthey move jobs outside the United States.Many industrial companies face intense pressure from Wall Street to increaseprofits, even when the economy grows slowly - a major reason United Technologiesdecided to move.That won't change after Mr. Trump takes office - especially when hourly pay inthe Indianapolis plant is equivalent to what workers in Mexico make in a day."This is a spot solution," said Mohan Tatikonda, a professor at the KelleySchool of Business at Indiana University. "If it goes through it helps someCarrier employees for a period of time, but it doesn't address the loss ofmanufacturing jobs to technological change, which will continue."PHOTO: The Carrier plant in Indianapolis, which employs 1,400.
