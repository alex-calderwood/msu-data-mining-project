HIGHLIGHT: Mr. Trump was widely criticized for baseless claims of voter fraud,and one of his advisers publicly denounced Mitt Romney, a contender to lead theState Department.President-elect Donald J. Trump met with David H. Petraeus on Monday as thebattle rages to fill the post of secretary of state.  Meanwhile, thepresident-elect is on Twitter again, threatening the Cuba thaw and lobbing voterfraud charges.There's still a secretary of state to name.David H. Petraeus, the retired general who led the C.I.A., met Monday withPresident-elect Trump, and it appears he really would like to be secretary ofstate."I was with him for about an hour," Mr. Petraeus told reporters. "He basicallywalked us around the world, showed a great grasp of a variety of the challengesthat are out there and some of the opportunities as well. Very goodconversation, and we'll see where it goes from here."The president-elect returned the compliment.Just met with General Petraeus--was very impressed! - Donald J. Trump(@realDonaldTrump) November 28, 2016Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, isup next with a meeting in Trump Tower on Tuesday. And Mitt Romney is set to havedinner with the president-elect on Tuesday night.Mr. Romney is the preferred choice of Vice President-elect Mike Pence and somebusiness leaders from whom Mr. Trump has heard. But contention over him beingchosen has led Mr. Trump's aides to open the process to other names, such as Mr.Corker.Typical of the pushback, L. Brent Bozell, a conservative media critic, said in astatement:"The very idea of Mitt Romney as Secretary of State - or any other cabinetposition in a Trump administration - is a slap to his supporters. Plenty ofpeople (myself included) opposed the President-elect, but virtually all endorsedhim once he was the nominee. Not so Romney and the DC elites."The pro-Romney camp is doing its own pushback. A person briefed on the process,who asked to remain anonymous to discuss sensitive conversations, said that Mr.Romney had not sought consideration for the secretary of state, and wasinitially contacted by Mr. Pence. In that first conversation, Mr. Romney madeclear to Mr. Pence that he would accept the position if the incoming presidentoffered it, the person said, contradicting the claim from others in Mr. Trump'scircle who are opposed to the potential appointment.The debate over Mr. Romney - and before him, Rudolph W. Giuliani - has given anopening to Mr. Petraeus, despite the cloud of scandal that still hangs over himfor sharing classified information during an extramarital affair.Trump warns on Cuba; White House pushes back.The president-elect has not held his punches in denouncing the predations ofFidel Castro, the late Cuban dictator, but he seemed to be keeping his optionsopen on President Obama's diplomatic thaw with the communist Caribbean nation.On Monday, via Twitter, Mr. Trump lobbed a threat about that.If Cuba is unwilling to make a better deal for the Cuban people, theCuban/American people and the U.S. as a whole, I will terminate deal. - DonaldJ. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 28, 2016Josh Earnest, the White House spokesman, isn't mourning Mr. Obama's initiativejust yet though.There will soon be 110 daily flights from the United States to Cuba, and cruise,tour and hotel operators have already invested significant sums ininfrastructure to support those visits. Citizens in Cuba and the United Statesoverwhelmingly support the new policy, Mr. Earnest said."So unrolling all of that is much more complicated than just the stroke of apen," Mr. Earnest said, adding, "It's just not as simple as one tweet might makeit seem."Michigan certifies results: Trump won.As a recount proceeds in Wisconsin, Michigan officially certified its results onMonday: Mr. Trump beat Hillary Clinton by 10,704 votes, or 0.2 percentagepoints.Michigan certifies results: Trump 2,279,543 (47.5%), Clinton 2,268,839 (47.3%),Others 250,902 (5.2%). https://t.co/j58GaxfPmH - Dave Wasserman (@Redistrict)November 28, 2016Mrs. Clinton's overall popular vote lead stands at 2,241,834.Just what are Trump and Obama talking about?Mr. Earnest confirmed Monday that President Obama and President-elect Trump hadspoken for 45 minutes on Saturday after Mr. Obama returned a call from the manwho will succeed him."President Obama has been doing this job for eight years, and he's learned a lotabout the kind of challenges a person in that job faces," Mr. Earnest said.But what are they talking about? Mr. Trump has hinted that Mr. Obama has toldhim of one big foreign policy concern: North Korea. And for good reason: Theautocratic government there is pressing ahead with efforts to develop anuclear-tipped missile that could reach American soil; a corruption crisis hasparalyzed South Korea's government; and Washington will soon be led by a newpresident with no governmental experience.California to Trump: Forget about it.When President-elect Trump claimed on Twitter that he was losing the popularvote because of massive voter fraud by millions of voters, one of the states hepointed to was California, where the latest voting returns showed HillaryClinton crushing Mr. Trump.Now the state's top election official, Alex Padilla, has responded. Mr. Padillaasserted that there was no evidence for the president-elect's claim, and hedenounced Mr. Trump for what he said was unpresidential behavior.pic.twitter.com/WfXISEBwzN - Alex Padilla (@AlexPadilla4CA) November 28, 2016This state has historically been slow to count ballots, a reflection of its sizeand the inefficiencies of many county voting operations. As of Saturday, Mrs.Clinton had received 8.1 million votes in California, compared with 4.2 millionfor Mr. Trump, according to Mr. Padilla's office. It was not clear when the votecount would be concluded.Mr. Padilla is the highest-ranking Latino elected to state office in California.Mr. Trump's poor showing there, many Democrats and Republicans said, came in nosmall part because of his attacks on what he described as the threat of illegalimmigration - particularly from Mexicans. About 40 percent of this state'spopulation is Latino.Another irresponsible attempt to undermine confidence in our elections. Baselessand counterproductive. https://t.co/DW3ETVTsVM - Alex Padilla (@AlexPadilla4CA)November 27, 2016'A shocking level of disdain ... 'Citing what they called Mr. Trump's "shocking level of disdain for legitimatebipartisan concerns" over conflicts of interest, the Democratic members of theHouse Oversight Committee on Monday formally requested that the committee'schairman open a review of the president-elect's web of global businessinterests.Oh, and they'd like copies of the tax returns that Mr. Trump has refused torelease.A Japanese restaurant is planned at Trump's new hotel.The president-elect's elegant new hotel, built in the Old Post Office buildingon Pennsylvania Avenue near the White House, has finally secured its secondrestaurant.The space at the Trump International Hotel has been empty since the celebritychefs José Andrés and Geoffrey Zakarian backed out in protest of Mr. Trump'sincendiary comments about Mexican immigrants during the campaign, promptinglegal action by the Trump organization.Now, Nakazawa, a Japanese omakase bar and dining room, is stepping up with a newrestaurant, to be opened by next summer."My decisions are not clouded by political views or what I feel in my heart,right or wrong," Alessandro Borgognone, Nakazawa's owner, told Washingtonianmagazine. "Anytime that we decide something on business, it's what's best forthe business."Congress appears to have a cure.The 114th Congress returns to Washington this week for one big order of business- besides keeping the government's lights on.In one of its final and most significant acts, the House on Wednesday is set topass the 21st Century Cures Act, an ambitious and pricey initiative that wouldderegulate some forms of drugs and medical devices and would fund PresidentObama's cancer "moonshot," Alzheimer's research, regenerative medicine andefforts to address opioid addiction. The agreement, reached between House andSenate negotiators over the Thanksgiving break, should be passed next month bythe Senate.The legislation's total funding for the National Institutes of Health is $4.8billion, a reduction from what the House sought last year. The bill, large as itis, is expected to pass with little debate and lots of lobbying fingerprints -and a bipartisan nod to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who wanted themoonshot.But Nancy Pelosi has a cold.Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House minority leader andlongtime head of the embattled House Democrats, faces something of a reckoningthis week.Representative Tim Ryan of Ohio, a burly former high school football player fromYoungstown, has had the temerity to challenge her for the minority leader post,saying the party needs to face the reality that Hillary Clinton's losses inOhio, Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania show that Democrats have lost touchwith their working-class roots.Even if, as likely, Ms. Pelosi survives the vote on Wednesday, she has shownvulnerability. The leadership slate that she has introduced includesRepresentative Cheri Bustos of a working-class corner of Illinois. In a letterto colleagues, she introduced her as "a leader representing the Heartland" who"has fought for manufacturing jobs and the needs of our veterans in ruralAmerica."Another offering? Representative Matt Cartwright, who "knows how to take theconcerns of his constituents in working-class Pennsylvania and translate theminto a message that moves people."The pushback?
