HIGHLIGHT: The social network, blocked in China since 2009, has developedsoftware to keep posts from appearing in users' news feeds in specificgeographic areas, current and former employees said.SAN FRANCISCO - Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's chief executive, has cultivatedrelationships with China's leaders, including President Xi Jinping. He has paidmultiple visits to the country to meet its top internet executives. He has madean effort to learn Mandarin.Inside Facebook, the work to enter China runs far deeper.The social network has quietly developed software to suppress posts fromappearing in people's news feeds in specific geographic areas, according tothree current and former Facebook employees, who asked for anonymity because thetool is confidential. The feature was created to help Facebook get into China, amarket where the social network has been blocked, these people said. Mr.Zuckerberg has supported and defended the effort, the people added.Facebook has restricted content in other countries before, such as Pakistan,Russia and Turkey, in keeping with the typical practice of American internetcompanies that generally comply with government requests to block certaincontent after it is posted. Facebook blocked roughly 55,000 pieces of contentinabout 20 countries between July 2015 and December 2015, for example. But the newfeature takes that a step further by preventing content from appearing in feedsin China in the first place.Facebook does not intend to suppress the posts itself. Instead, it would offerthe software to enable a third party - in this case, most likely a partnerChinese company - to monitor popular stories and topics that bubble up as usersshare them across the social network, the people said. Facebook's partner wouldthen have full control to decide whether those posts should show up in users'feeds.The current and former Facebook employees caution that the software is one ofmany ideas the company has discussed with respect to entering China and, likemany experiments inside Facebook, it may never see the light of day. Thefeature, whose code is visible to engineers inside the company, has so far goneunused, and there is no indication that Facebook has offered it to theauthorities in China.But the project illustrates the extent to which Facebook may be willing tocompromise one of its core mission statements, "to make the world more open andconnected," to gain access to a market of 1.4 billion Chinese people. Even asFacebook faces pressure to continue growing - Mr. Zuckerberg has often askedwhere the company's next billion users will come from - China has been cordonedoff to the social network since 2009 because of the government's strict rulesaround censorship of user content.The suppression software has been contentious within Facebook, which isseparately grappling with what should or should not be shown to its users afterthe American presidential election's unexpected outcome spurred questions overfake news on the social network. Several employees who were working on theproject have left Facebook after expressing misgivings about it, according tothe current and former employees.A Facebook spokeswoman said in a statement, "We have long said that we areinterested in China, and are spending time understanding and learning more aboutthe country." She added that the company had made no decisions on its approachinto China.Facebook's tricky position underscores the difficulties that many Americaninternet companies have had gaining access to China. For years, companies likeGoogle and Twitter have been blocked there for refusing to yield to thegovernment's demands around censorship. In 2010, Google said it was directingusers of its search engine in China to its service in Hong Kong, because ofcensorship and intrusion from hackers. Other companies, like the professionalsocial networking service LinkedIn, agreed to censor some content on theirplatforms in China.The current climate for internet companies in China may not help Facebook. InAugust, the ride-hailing giant Uber gave up an expensive battle to crack theChinese market, selling its Chinese business to an incumbent rival, DidiChuxing. More broadly, China has streamlined and tightened its controls over theinternet under President Xi, targeting influential social media celebrities andadding new reviews to popular online video sites.Still, some officials responsible for China's tech policy have been willing toentertain the idea of Facebook's operating in the country. It would legitimizeChina's strict style of internet governance, and if done according to officialstandards, would enable easy tracking of political opinions deemed problematic.Even so, resistance remains at the top levels of Chinese leadership.Some analysts have said Facebook's best option is to follow a model laid out byother internet companies and cooperate with a local company or investor. Findinga partner - and potentially allowing it to own a majority stake in Facebook'sChina operation - would take the burden of censorship and surveillance off theSilicon Valley company. It would also let Facebook rely on a local company'sgovernment connections and experience to deal with the difficult task ofcommunicating with Beijing.Facebook and Chinese officials have had intermittent talks in the last few yearsabout the social network's entering the market, according to employees who wereinvolved in the discussions, though the two sides have been unable to reach acompromise.Facebook currently sells advertising for some Chinese businesses from its HongKong office. Among its customers are state-media sites that act as thepropaganda arm of the Chinese government, and that operate official accountswhere they post articles. Chinese citizens who wish to gain access to Facebookmust tunnel in using a technology known as a virtual private network, or VPN.It's unclear when the suppression tool originated, but the project picked upmomentum in the last year, as engineers were plucked from other parts ofFacebook to work on the effort, the current and former employees said. Theproject was led by Vaughan Smith, a vice president for mobile, corporate andbusiness development at Facebook, they said. Like Mr. Zuckerberg, Mr. Smithspeaks a smattering of Mandarin.Unveiling a new censorship tool in China could lead to more demands to suppresscontent from other countries. The fake-news problem, which has hit countriesacross the globe, has already led some governments to use the issue as an excuseto target sites of political rivals, or shut down social media sites altogether.Over the summer, several Facebook employees who were working on the suppressiontool left the company, the current and former employees said. Internally, somany employees asked about the project and its ambitions on an internal forumthat, in July, it became a topic at one of Facebook's weekly Friday afternoonquestion-and-answer sessions.Mr. Zuckerberg was at the event and answered a question from the audience aboutthe tool. He told the gathering that Facebook's China plans were nascent. But healso struck a pragmatic tone about the future, according to employees whoattended the session."It's better for Facebook to be a part of enabling conversation, even if it'snot yet the full conversation," Mr. Zuckerberg said, according to employees.Paul Mozur contributed reporting from Hong Kong.PHOTO: President Xi Jinping of China, center, with Mark Zuckerberg, right, thechief executive of Facebook, and Lu Wei, then China's Internet czar, in a 2015gathering in Redmond, Wash.
