HIGHLIGHT:Â The president-elect made the unsubstantiated claim as part of a stormof Twitter posts voicing anger about a three-state recount push.WASHINGTON - President-elect Donald J. Trump said on Sunday that he had fallenshort in the popular vote in the general election only because millions ofpeople had voted illegally, leveling the baseless claim as part of a daylongstorm of Twitter posts voicing anger about a three-state recount push."In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popularvote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally," Mr. Trump wroteSunday afternoon.The series of posts came one day after Hillary Clinton's campaign said it wouldparticipate in a recount effort being undertaken in Wisconsin, and potentiallyin similar pushes in Michigan and Pennsylvania, by Jill Stein, who was the GreenParty candidate. Mr. Trump's statements revived claims he made during thecampaign, as polls suggested he was losing to Mrs. Clinton, about a rigged andcorrupt system.The Twitter outburst also came as Mr. Trump is laboring to fill crucialpositions in his cabinet, with his advisers enmeshed in a rift over whom heshould select as secretary of state. On Sunday morning, Kellyanne Conway, a topadviser, extended a public campaign to undermine one contender, Mitt Romney - aremarkable display by a member of a president-elect's team. In televisionappearances, she accused Mr. Romney of having gone "out of his way to hurt" Mr.Trump during the Republican primary contests.Claims of wide-scale voter fraud have been advanced for years by Republicans,though virtually no evidence of such improprieties has been discovered -especially on the scale of "millions" that Mr. Trump claimed.Late on Sunday, again without providing evidence, he referred in a Twitter postto "serious voter fraud in Virginia, New Hampshire and California."A day earlier, Mr. Trump's transition team ridiculed the idea that recounts wereneeded. "This is a scam by the Green Party for an election that has already beenconceded," it said in a statement, "and the results of this election should berespected instead of being challenged and abused."That message runs counter to the one Mr. Trump sent on Sunday with his fraudclaims - if millions of people voted illegally, presumably officials across thecountry would want to pursue large-scale ballot recounts and fraudinvestigations.But the Twitter posts could energize some of his supporters, who have claimedonline that Mrs. Clinton's two million-vote lead in the popular vote has beenfaked. Mr. Trump at times promoted other conspiracy theories during thecampaign, including claiming that Senator Ted Cruz's father was somehow tied tothe assassination of President John F. Kennedy.Many of Mrs. Clinton's supporters have been galvanized by the notion that voterecounts in the three states - where Mr. Trump leads by a combined total ofabout 100,000 votes - could somehow overturn Mr. Trump's commanding ElectoralCollege victory. By announcing, three weeks after Mrs. Clinton conceded, that itwould participate in the Wisconsin recount, her team has helped reignite thecontentious atmosphere of the campaign, of which Mr. Trump's Twitter barrageswere a fixture. (By all accounts, Mr. Trump types out many, though not all, ofhis own Twitter posts.)After spending almost five days in Palm Beach, Fla., where he celebratedThanksgiving at his Mar-a-Lago resort, Mr. Trump made no public statements onSunday other than those via Twitter. He returned in the afternoon to Trump Towerin Manhattan.Through the day, Mr. Trump appeared fixated on the recount and his electoralperformance. In a series of midafternoon Twitter posts, not long before heboarded his flight, Mr. Trump boasted that he could have easily won the"so-called popular vote" if he had campaigned only in "3 or 4" states,presumably populous ones."I would have won even more easily and convincingly (but smaller states areforgotten)!" he wrote.The afternoon messages followed a string of early-morning Twitter posts in whichMr. Trump railed against the recount efforts. In an initial post at 7:19, hewrote: "Hillary Clinton conceded the election when she called me just prior tothe victory speech and after the results were in. Nothing will change."He went on to quote a comment by Mrs. Clinton during one of their debates, inwhich she said she was horrified by Mr. Trump's refusal to say that he wouldaccept the outcome of the election. And he noted that in her concession speech,she had urged people to respect the vote results."'We have to accept the results and look to the future, Donald Trump is going tobe our President,'" Mr. Trump wrote, quoting Mrs. Clinton.One person who spoke with Mr. Trump over the holiday weekend said thepresident-elect had appeared to be preoccupied by suggestions that a recountmight be started, even as his aides played down any concerns. Another friendsaid Mr. Trump felt crossed by Mrs. Clinton, who he believed had conceded therace and accepted the results.In a post on Medium, Marc Elias, the Clinton team's general counsel, said thecampaign would participate in Ms. Stein's recount effort with little expectationthat it would change the result, partly out of a sense of duty to the millionswho voted for Mrs. Clinton."We do so fully aware that the number of votes separating Donald Trump andHillary Clinton in the closest of these states - Michigan - well exceeds thelargest margin ever overcome in a recount," Mr. Elias said, noting that Clintoncampaign officials had found no "actionable evidence" of hacking or attempts totamper with the vote.Late Sunday night, Mr. Elias responded on Twitter to Mr. Trump's allegations,writing, "We are getting attacked for participating in a recount that we didn'task for by the man who won election but thinks there was massive fraud."In Wisconsin, Mr. Trump leads by 22,177 votes. In Michigan, he has a lead of10,704 votes, and in Pennsylvania, his advantage is 70,638 votes.Mr. Trump's aides echoed his concerns about the recount effort in appearances onSunday morning television news programs. Ms. Conway, who was his campaignmanager, said on NBC's "Meet the Press" that Mrs. Clinton and her campaignadvisers would have to decide "whether they're going to be a bunch ofcrybabies."As for the debate over Mr. Romney, Ms. Conway, echoing comments she posted lastweek on Twitter, made clear that she opposed choosing Mr. Romney as secretary ofstate."There was the 'Never Trump' movement, and then there was Gov. Mitt Romney," shesaid on ABC. During the primaries, Mr. Romney called Mr. Trump a "fraud" and a"phony."Ms. Conway said it was important for Mr. Trump to seek to unify the RepublicanParty by making gestures to those who opposed his candidacy. But, she added, "Idon't think the cost of party unity has to be the secretary of state position."Moments after appearing on the show, Ms. Conway, who is under consideration tobe Mr. Trump's press secretary, wrote on Twitter that she had told Mr. Trump heropinion privately, "and I'll respect his decision."On "Meet the Press," she said people felt "betrayed" by the idea that Mr. Romneycould get a top cabinet job. "I'm not campaigning against anyone," she said."I'm just a concerned citizen.""We don't even know if he voted for Donald Trump," she added.Michael D.
