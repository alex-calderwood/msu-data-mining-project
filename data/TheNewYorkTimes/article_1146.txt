HIGHLIGHT: In every presidential race, there are early and fierce endorsers ofthe winning candidate who are then viewed, postelection, as having moreinfluence.In Maine, where Gov. Paul R. LePage backed Donald J. Trump's campaign for thepresidency, some political observers are wondering if the state will soon seeresults from that. Might Mr. Trump lend his support, for instance, to reversinga recent federal parkland designation that Mr. LePage strongly opposed?In North Dakota, whose only member of the House of Representatives, KevinCramer, was an early supporter of Mr. Trump and advised him on energy policy,some suggest that Mr. Trump's administration will allow the completion of thefiercely protested Dakota Access oil pipeline, as Mr. Cramer has urged.And in Iowa, where Gov. Terry E. Branstad pushedstrongly for Mr. Trump, somebelieve that the new president will help the state hold on to its coveted statusas the first in the nation to hold presidential caucuses.In every race for the White House, there are early and fierce endorsers of thewinning candidate who are then viewed, postelection, as having greaterinfluence. Some are courted for cabinet spots, but more seek the president's earon state policies, federal funds and infrastructure projects. Rarely, though,are the lines as stark as in this election, largely because some Republicanleaders took the unusual step of not endorsing Mr. Trump - early or ever. Andwhat this means now for the ones who did is far from clear."It'll be great to have a governor and a president who work well together, and Ithink it'll benefit Florida greatly," Brian Ballard, a Florida lobbyist, said ofGov. Rick Scott, another steadfast supporter of Mr. Trump, who posted photos onTwitter from a meeting he had with Mr. Trump on Thursday.Great seeing my friend @realDonaldTrump today. pic.twitter.com/yJAMbHsXp5 - RickScott (@FLGovScott) November 17, 2016Could more federal help come when the next hurricane rolls into Florida? Mightthere be a way for the state to get a leg up in its longstanding water war withneighboring states?"He's a person Mr. Trump has known a long time," Mr. Ballard said of thegovernor. "They work well together, and I think his counsel will be wellreceived."The flip side, too, is being imagined. Will states with Republican governors whosaid they did not support Mr. Trump (like Massachusetts, Nevada and New Mexico)or who chose not to endorse him (like Michigan) be penalized?After Gov. John Kasich of Ohio said he could not support Mr. Trump, Ohio "maynot be at the top of the pecking order when it comes to discretionary dollars,"acknowledged Michael Gonidakis, a Republican political consultant who leads thestate's Right to Life organization."He's going to reward those states where the leaders and establishment were outthere supporting him," Mr. Gonidakis said. "But Ohio won't be last in lineeither. I think Donald Trump is a bigger person than that."Mr. Kasich declined an interview request through his spokesman.Not everyone believes that Mr. Trump's pre-election relations with localofficials will matter all that much - or any more than they have in otheradministrations. John Hibbing, a political scientist at the University ofNebraska-Lincoln, said he was skeptical about how much political leverage thefederal government would exert over states and cities.Other political analysts noted that the new administration's decisions on issuesthat affect states, like energy, environmental regulation and health care, mightsimply align philosophically with the wishes of Republican governors, regardlessof whether they backed Mr. Trump in the election.Still, many analysts said, lots of people will be making requests in the comingdays, and those who backed him when others did not may have a simpler path."This governor has a number of times proposed welfare reforms, aimed at fightingfraud, that were viewed negatively by the federal government," Mark Brewer, apolitical scientist at the University of Maine, said of Mr. LePage. "I'd put mymoney on him going back to ask on this, if he hasn't already. Given the varietyof options, you have to wonder what a LePage administration can do now that itcouldn't have requested under President Obama."The governor's office did not respond to a phone inquiry.Among Republicans at the local level, the issue seemed somewhat more removed.After a recording emerged in October of Mr. Trump talking about sexuallyassaulting women, Jean Stothert, the mayor of Omaha, issued a statementcondemning the comments as "repulsive." And after Election Day, Ms. Stotherttold reporters that she had chosen Senator John McCain of Arizona as a write-incandidate.Was Ms. Stothert concerned about fallout for Omaha with the White House now?"I certainly hope nothing like that would pan out," she said in an interview. "Iwould hope no city would be retaliated on because of what position the mayortook."She added that she supported Mr. Trump now that he had been elected. "You dohave to respect the office of the president," she said. "You hope and pray theydo well."In Tulsa, Okla., after delivering his final State of the City address last week,Mayor Dewey F. Bartlett Jr., who leaves office in early December, gave the crowdat a regional chamber of commerce meeting some unexpected news. Asked what hewould do next, Mr. Bartlett said he was trying to get in touch with Mr. Trump'stransition team to ask to be considered for secretary of transportation."I feel that it's very reasonable that that would be considered because of theexperience I've had in transportation," Mr. Bartlett said in an interview,noting his past work for the state's turnpike authority and as a pilot.Mr. Bartlett was an outspoken supporter of Mr. Trump for months. It was aposition he took criticism for as he sought re-election in June, and he said hethought it might have contributed to his loss. For the moment, he said lastweek, he was still trying to figure out how best to get in touch with the Trumpteam.Get politics and Washington news updates via Facebook, Twitter and in theMorning Briefing newsletter.PHOTOS: Gov.
