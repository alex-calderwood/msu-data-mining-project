HIGHLIGHT: Echoing the governor, Mayor Bill de Blasio pledged to challenge thecreation of a Muslim registry and promised to protect immigrants threatened withdeportation.Faced with a Republican president-elect willing to draw hard lines onimmigration, policing and funding for social programs, Mayor Bill de Blasio in aformal address on Monday drew some of his own, presenting New York City as anational model of resistance and "a better way."Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, vowed to mount a legal challenge if the federalgovernment tried to create a registry of the nation's Muslims. He promised toprotect immigrant families threatened with deportation. He pledged that anaggressive stop-and-frisk policing policy would never return to New York."The president-elect talked during the campaign about the movement that he hadbuilt," said the mayor, referring to Donald J. Trump and the huge rallies heled. "Now, it's our turn to build a movement - a movement of the majority thatbelieves in respect and dignity for all."The mayor's 40-minute speech - billed as a major address and delivered tosupporters, invited guests and 11 center rows filled with city workers at CooperUnion - echoed in theme and some content one that another Democrat, Gov. AndrewM. Cuomo, delivered a day before, also in Manhattan.Mr. Cuomo, in his remarks at the Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem, said hewould create a new unit of the State Police to investigate hate crimes, move toexpand state human rights law and seek new funds to provide legal representationto immigrants. Mr. de Blasio, too, said he would provide immigrants withlawyers, working with the City Council to do so.Mr. de Blasio's speech, delivered as he has begun his own re-election campaign,included several instances of call-and-response with the friendly crowd drawnfrom the full panoply of New York diversity, both in the seats and on the dais.An openly lesbian Protestant chaplain from the Fire Department helped to openthe gathering along with an imam from the Police Department.Mr. de Blasio spoke from a lectern adorned with a hashtag - #AlwaysNewYork -meant to inspire tales of solidarity and pride in New York values. He remindedthe audience that Mr. Trump defended those values in abstract on the campaigntrail during the Republican primary contests."We ain't changing," Mr. de Blasio said, before listing his promises to defendNew Yorkers from deportation, unconstitutional police practices and any cuts tofederal funding for Planned Parenthood. "We will ensure women receive the healthcare they need."Former city lawyers said the mayor could rely on the federalism of theConstitution as well as established case law to challenge undesired programsfrom Washington. It could be many more months, if not years, before the issueswould be resolved in court."There is important value in reassuring people that the city and the statemaintain considerable sovereignty over its own policy," said Victor A. Kovner, apartner at Davis Wright Tremaine and a former city corporation counsel.The federal government may have broad authority over immigration, said MichaelA. Cardozo, a partner at Proskauer who served as the corporation counsel underMayor Michael R. Bloomberg, a Republican turned political independent. "Butthose laws do not give the federal government carte blanche to do whatever itwants with an immigrant."Since the presidential election provided a shock to residents in the city and inmany areas of the state, Mr. de Blasio and Mr. Cuomo have offered similarmessages, appealing to Mr. Trump's New York roots while also presentingthemselves as defenders of their constituents who are worried about a newadministration that neither of them supported during the campaign.The speeches were met with derision from state Republicans on Monday. Edward F.Cox, the chairman of the state Republican Party, in a statement accused both ofa "naked and unseemly fight" to position themselves for a future presidentialrun."These two scorpions in a bottle are each trying to outdo one another withslanderous fear-mongering hyperbole," he said.Asked about Mr. de Blasio's attempt to calm fearful New Yorkers, KellyanneConway, a top adviser to Mr. Trump, mocked the mayor to reporters outside TrumpTower: "Fearful of the jobs he's killed? Fearful of the bike lanes?"That sentiment was repeated in the response to Mr. de Blasio's hashtag, whichfor much of Monday provided a forum on Twitter for those opposed to his handlingof the city to vent frustrations, as well as for supporters."Mayor de Blasio rolled over for the N.Y.P.D. after they did a back-turningprotest," one user wrote. "You think he won't roll over for Trump?""So proud to be a New Yorker," another wrote. "They should both be impeached,"another said of the mayor and the governor.Even with a shared antagonist in Mr. Trump, Mr. de Blasio and Mr. Cuomo have notbeen able to bridge the gap between them that, those close to both men say, hasseemingly widened beyond repair. They have not held an event together since theelection and have appeared content to go their own way in assuaging the concernsof New Yorkers, even as they end up finding very similar ways of doing so."We will stand up and say, 'Yes we are black, white and brown - but we areone,'" Mr. Cuomo said in his speech.Mr. de Blasio said in his remarks the next day, "To all Latinos who heard theirculture denigrated - we stand by you.""Yes we are Christian, Muslim and Jews, but we are one," Mr. Cuomo said."To all the Muslims who have heard their faith belittled - we stand by you," Mr.de Blasio said."And that is the New York way," Mr. Cuomo said."We are always New York," Mr. de Blasio ended.PHOTO: Mayor Bill de Blasio on Monday promised to defend New Yorkers fromdeportation and unconstitutional police practices.
