ON THURSDAY morning, bands, floats and balloons bobbed through downtownPhiladelphia, extending a 97-year tradition - the Thanksgiving Day parade,America's oldest.And boy, did the city - and, arguably, the country - need a parade.Along the 1.4-mile route, the festivities seemed an effective salve to the rawfeelings lingering from an extraordinarily divisive presidential campaign thatexposed radical differences over how Americans think about race, gender andreligion.Among the revelers who in spots lined JFK Boulevard three-deep were MaxineFredric and her 12-year-old niece, Faith Reyes, who took a train in fromNorristown.Despite the contentious presidential election and other stresses of 2016,Fredric, a portfolio administrator, declared it a good year."I'm waking up every day," she said as a passing band played "Yankee DoodleDandy." "I appreciate the little things."Also watching were Alice Dale and her 20-year-old daughter, Samantha Dennis, whoshared their very different political perspectives."I'm thankful for everything that happened," Dale said of the election that issending developer and reality-TV star Donald Trump to the White House. "I'm veryhopeful."Dennis is not."I'd like to gladly disagree," she said. "I don't deal with bigotry well, and Idon't deal with stupidity very well."But they laughed about their diverse views. For the most part, they don't talkpolitics, said the South Jersey natives, who now live in Wilmington, N.C., andwere excited to be in Philadelphia for the holiday."I feel like I'm back home," Dennis said.The parade route began at 20th Street and JFK Boulevard and turned onto 16thStreet on its way to the Benjamin Franklin Parkway and the Philadelphia Museumof Art.Near a stairway leading down to the Broad Street Line, Alton May watched SantaClaus and the end of the parade with his 7-year-old son, Nafis, on hisshoulders. It was the West Philadelphian's first trip to the parade in about adecade.Asked whether he felt thankful this year, he had a mixed response."No," he said, "because Trump is in office."On the other hand, he said, he was able to buy a house this year.Despite the tumultuous year, many people answered unhesitatingly that they feltthe spirit of the holiday. As balloon versions of children's book characters theGrinch and the Very Hungry Caterpillar loomed above, parade-watchers said theywere thankful they could spend the holiday with family and friends."I'm just thankful for him," Washington resident Sharonda Harper said of husbandErik, as they stood at 17th Street and JFK Boulevard. "We just got married twomonths ago."Standing away from the crowd near JFK Plaza, medical student Cara Smith of SouthPhiladelphia cradled her sleeping 4-month-old son, Desmond. Wrapped in blanketsand wearing a stocking cap shaped like a cooked turkey, Desmond slept as a brassband performing Christmas music marched past."It's been a pretty rough year," Smith said. "My grandmother just passed away,so I'm just happy to be with the family that's here."Her husband, Shea O'Neill, said he was most thankful for his wife and son.Smith's stepmother, Ann Ricksecker, thought for a moment about what she wasthankful for this year."We're all unanimous," she finally said, looking at the sleeping infant. "It'sall about him."jlaughlin@phillynews.com
