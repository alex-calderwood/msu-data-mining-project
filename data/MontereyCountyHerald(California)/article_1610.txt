He seems to lackthe desire to put public good above his personal gain.Republican leaders now have come into power. Hopefully some of them will havethe gumption to stand up to the new president when he tramples on what has beenour country's norms for presidential behavior.- Carolyn Rice, CarmelGive Trump the chance      to pleasantly surprise usIt is becoming more and more difficult to read the Opinion page of The Heraldand, in particular, to read the editorial cartoon (the day after Thanksgivingcartoon was particularly nasty). Donald Trump is about to become president ofour country. All we seem to be reading in The Herald these days is negativeswith respect to him.Remember the old Beatles song, "Give Peace a Chance"? Can't we give Mr. Trump achance as well? He just may pleasantly surprise some of your readers.- Joan Bizzozero, MontereyFree use of certain terms a form of bigotrySince the Nov. 8 presidential election, I have seen the following words bandiedfreely by left-wing political columnists: racist, sexist, xenophobic,misogynist. Remember the Salem witch trials, where innocent women were accusedand burned at the stake? Remember the "Red Scare" during the McCarthy era, wheremany who were not guilty were blacklisted as communists? Aren't these goodexamples of fear-mongering and bigotry?I think The Monterey Herald should hold a moratorium on the words such asracist, sexist, xenophobic. Words like these and especially random references tothe Ku Klux Klan are a form of bigotry. There must be a more graceful way oftransitioning from the old to the new after the most recent election thanresorting to name-calling, fear-mongering and bigotry.- Carol Marquart, Pacific GroveTo the disrespectful secessionists, adiosTo those who want California to secede from the Union, a short history lesson:the last time the election of a president precipitated a secessionist movementby the disgruntled losers - in 1861 - it didn't work out so well. Some advice:free elections work like this: Take a vote, then everyone accepts the result,win or lose. If you don't like the results, just shut up, and next time choose abetter candidate.Since that procedure apparently doesn't appeal to you, I have a better proposal:Just leave. That way you won't be saddled with the "humiliation" of acceptingthe clearly (in your minds) neo-fascist election results, and we - meaning therest of California and the country - won't have to endure the ongoingembarrassment of a bunch of disrespectful, disloyal, flag-burning, riotouswhiners.Cheers ... and adios!- Rich Saylor, Monterey, California, USAMonterey's high-level CERT a national modelNine years ago, when effects of the recession strained the Monterey city budget,the then-fire chief and city manager decided to eliminate the CommunityEmergency Response Team (CERT) program. Intent was to save overtime money paidto firefighters managing and instructing the program. CERT was fading from yearsof inattention by city officials.CERT citizen volunteers stepped forward and took over the program. Instruction,management and equipment outfitting of neighborhood containers was undertaken bycitizens. What emerged is today the premier CERT program in the Nation! MontereyCERT is the only program featured in both Fire Engineering Magazine andEmergency Management Magazine on "How to Start A CERT Program In YourCommunity." Monterey CERT is now used as a model across America. This is becauseof the very high level of service provided. More than a disaster response force,CERT volunteers respond to storm emergencies, searches for missing persons,coastal incidents where someone has been swept out to sea, and a host of otheremergencies.The City Council of Monterey deserves credit for funding tools equipment to keepCERT modernized.CERT training is offered in March and is free.
