INDIANAPOLIS - Lawyers for Republican Mike Pence, who is Indiana governor andthe vice president-elect, argued in court Monday that the state's judicialbranch has no authority to require him to comply with Indiana's public recordslaw.The civil case before Indiana's Court of Appeals was brought by Indianapolisattorney William Groth, who sued in 2015 after the Pence administration denied arequest for unredacted records, including a document related to Republicanefforts to stop President Barack Obama's immigration executive order.Pence has long presented himself as a champion of a free press and the FirstAmendment. That's a contrast to President-elect Donald Trump, who made attackson reporters a hallmark of his campaign and refused to release his tax recordsas other modern presidential candidates have done.In March, Pence vetoed a bill that would have exempted private universities fromreleasing some police records, calling it "a disservice to the public and anunnecessary barrier to transparency."And on the campaign trail he aggressively criticized Democrat Hillary Clintonfor refusing to release emails sent from a private server she maintained whilesecretary of state.But Pence's gubernatorial administration has argued against the public releaseof emails and other documents that could shed light on his tenure as governor.In some cases, his office has withheld documents, delayed responses or flatlydenied public records requests filed by the Associated Press and other newsorganizations.On Monday, Pence attorney Joseph Chapelle told the judges that the separation ofpowers established under the state's constitution should prevent the courtsystem from forcing Pence and his immediate staff to comply with the openrecords law if they are sued."Inquiry into the personal papers of the governor would (interfere) with theaffairs with of the governor's office," Chapelle said."He's different than other state agencies."
