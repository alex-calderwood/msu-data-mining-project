BIRMINGHAM, Ala. - Donald Trump's election is bringing to the fore a strain ofrace-based politics once so far out of the mainstream few had even heard of it.With an ideology that's a mix of racism, white nationalism and old-fashionedpopulism, the "alt-right" has burst into the collective consciousness sincemembers showed up at the Republican National Convention to celebrate Trump'snomination last summer.When one of its leaders, Richard Spencer, gave a speech in Washington lastSaturday at an alt-right conference attended by a couple of hundred people, TheAtlantic magazine was there with a video camera that captured the Nazi-stylesalutes of people in his audience."Hail Trump, hail our people, hail victory!" Spencer said to cheers that wereshown in video snippets that have since been viewed hundreds of thousands oftimes online.What does Spencer mean by "our people"? Whites.Spencer directs the National Policy Institute, which describes itself as"dedicated to the heritage, identity and future of people of European descent inthe United States and around the world."It is Spencer who is widely credited with coming up with the term "alt-right,"or "alternative-right," about eight years go.While members of the movement are getting more attention than ever, the head ofthe Anti-Defamation League's Center on Extremism said Tuesday that there is notmuch new in its message."The hatred and bigotry that is at the core of alt-right ideology has notchanged," center director Oren Segal said in an interview conducted by privatemessaging. "What has changed is the name, their packaging and the stated beliefthat they have a champion in the highest office."On Tuesday, the president-elect distanced himself from the alt-right movement,saying he did not want to "energize" the white supremacist and nationalistgroups."I disavow and condemn them," Trump said during a wide-ranging interview withstaff members of The New York Times.Trump has faced continued criticism over his choosing Steve Bannon, who managedthe final months of the billionaire businessman's presidential campaign, aschief White House strategist. Bannon was previously the leader of BreitbartNews, an unapologetically conservative outlet that Bannon has described as a"platform for the alt-right."At the Times on Tuesday, Trump said Breitbart "is just a publication" that"covers subjects on the right" and is "certainly a much more conservative paper,to put it mildly, than The New York Times."Richard Cohen, president of the Alabama-based Southern Poverty Law Center, anorganization that tracks hate groups, said the alt-right is "a rebranding ofwhite nationalism." Cohen called it "the energy behind the avalanche of racistand anti-Semitic harassment that plagued social media platforms for the entirepresidential campaign."Members of the alt-right, including Spencer, are vocal in their support ofTrump.In an interview with The Associated Press in Cleveland, where members of thealt-right obtained credentials to attend the Republican National Convention,Spencer painted himself and Trump as people who think alike."Do you think it's a coincidence that everybody like me loves Trump and supportshim?" he said.
