BOISE, Idaho - Grass-roots campaigns have sprung up around the country to try topersuade members of the Electoral College to do something that has never beendone in American history: deny the presidency to the clear Election Day winner.Activists are circulating online petitions and using social media in hopes ofinfluencing Republican electors to cast their ballots for someone other thanPresident-elect Donald Trump and deprive him of the 270 Electoral College votesneeded to become the next occupant of the White House."Yes, I think it's a long shot, but I also think we're living in strange times,"said Daniel Brezenoff, who created a petition in favor of Hillary Clinton and isasking signers to lobby electors by email or phone. "If it was ever plausible,it's this year."Trump has won 290 electoral votes to Clinton's 232, with Michigan undecided, butClinton is on pace to win the popular vote by at least 1 million ballots.Trump's opponents are motivated by the outcome of the popular vote and by theircontention that the businessman and reality TV star is unfit to serve ascommander in chief.Just one elector so far has wavered publicly on supporting Trump. TexasRepublican Art Sisneros says he has reservations about the president-elect."As a Christian, I came to the conclusion that Mr. Trump is not biblicallyqualified for that office," he said.He said he had heard from ecstatic Clinton supporters and even supportiveRepublicans, but also from outraged Trump backers writing "threatening and vilethings."Sisneros signed a state party pledge to support the GOP's standard-bearer, butthat was before Trump was the official nominee. Sisneros said one of his optionswas to resign, allowing the state party to choose another elector.Electors are chosen by party officials and are typically the party's most loyalmembers. Presidential electors are not required to vote for a particularcandidate under the Constitution. Even so, the National Archives says more than99 percent of electors have voted as pledged throughout the nation's history.Some state laws call for fines against "faithless electors," while others openthem to potential felony charges, although the National Archives says no electorhas ever been prosecuted for failing to vote as pledged. In North Carolina, afaithless elector's vote is canceled, and he or she must immediately resign andbe replaced.Layne Bangerter and Melinda Smyser, two of Idaho's four Republican electors,said they had been flooded with emails, telephone calls and Facebook messagesfrom strangers urging them to reconsider their vote."It's just not going to work," Bangerter said.The volume and tone of the messages caught the attention of Idaho's secretary ofstate, who urged the public to remain civil as electors prepare to cast theirballots on Dec. 19 while meeting in their states.Republican Party officials in Georgia and Michigan said their electors also hadbeen bombarded with messages, and Iowa reported increased public interest inobtaining contact information for electors.Carole Jean Jordan, a GOP elector from Florida in 2000, recalled the"unbelievably ugly" aftermath of the recount battle between George W. Bush andthen-Vice President Al Gore, a dispute that ended with the Supreme Court'sleaving Bush's slim margin intact and handing him the presidency.Jordan said Florida's electors had been inundated with nasty letters from peoplesaying they should not vote for Bush.CABINET PROGRESSPresident-elect Donald Trump met Saturday at his golf club in Bedminster, N.J.,with an eclectic mix of potential Cabinet picks, including high-profileRepublican foe Mitt Romney, a former presidential candidate Trump is believed tobe considering for secretary of state.Also getting face time with Trump on Saturday were Michelle Rhee, the firebrandCalifornia education activist and nemesis of teachers unions, who is a contenderfor the post of education secretary. The meetings were scheduled to continueSunday.
