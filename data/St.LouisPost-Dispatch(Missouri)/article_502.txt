HONOLULU - A donor has pulled his support for students at the University ofHawaii after the art department's chairwoman organized a sign-painting party atwhich some people used art to protest President-elect Donald Trump.Chairwoman Gaye Chan said she used her personal Facebook page to invite peopleto paint signs together on campus."Regardless of who you voted for, or if at all, there will be long-term resultsthat will negatively impact us all," she said on her Facebook page. "People arealready experiencing misogynist and racist harassment. Let's unite by showingsolidarity by attending two events tomorrow."Chan's post upset donor Mark Blackburn, a Trump supporter, who said he didn'tthink Chan should use state property to promote a political agenda."I said, 'You know what, I don't think this is right, and I'm going to vote withmy checkbook on this thing,'" Blackburn said.Chan said she had drafted the Facebook post on her own time and didn't useuniversity resources. The sign-painting took place on "a piece of concrete in apublic space that any member of the public can use," she said.Chan thanked Blackburn and his wife for their past contributions, adding thatshe had no animosity toward them.University spokesman Dan Meisenzahl said that Chan didn't violate universitypolicies with her Facebook post and that professors regularly participated inprotests over telescopes built on mountains held sacred by Native Hawaiians,genetically modified organisms and other issues."It's a university," Meisenzahl said. "It's an institution of higher education.You're supposed to debate ideas."Blackburn estimates he gave at least $40,000 for scholarships and programs atthe university over the past couple of years. He invested money to start apop-up art gallery that showcases students' work, and has spent money to flystudents and their work to galleries in Santa Fe, N.M., and New York, he said.Meisenzahl said Blackburn's direct donations to the university were closer to$14,000.The difference in estimates could be due to expenses Blackburn incurred openingan art agency outside the university that benefited students, Chan said."This guy is trying to limit free speech with his money," said Alan Ness, agraduate who obtained his masters in fine arts from the university in 2008. "Theuniversities are already underfunded, and now this guy is just exacerbating theproblem by pulling his funds for the arts because he doesn't like what the artsare saying."
