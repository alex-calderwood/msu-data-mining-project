WASHINGTON - Here's the idea: Swiftly pass a repeal of President Barack Obama'ssignature Affordable Care Act health care law, perhaps soon enough for DonaldTrump to sign it the day he takes the presidential oath. Then approvelegislation restructuring the nation's huge and convoluted health care system -despite Republican divisions, Democratic opposition and millions of jitteryconstituents.What could go wrong?With Republicans controlling the White House and Congress in January, they'refaced with delivering on their longtime promise to repeal and replace Obamacare.Here are hurdles they'll face:SPEED VS. DELIBERATIONTrump and congressional Republicans will be under intense pressure from theircore conservative supporters to repeal the 2010 health care law - and fast.After all, Congress already sent Obama a repeal bill last January, which hevetoed.But this process is likely to take at least months.While the replacement effort is underway, Republicans will risk aggravating asmany as 30 million people who are covered by the law or buy policies with pricesaffected by its insurance marketplace.A SOLUTIONNothing's been decided, but here's one likely scenario:The new Congress, which convenes Jan. 3, tries to quickly approve legislationrepealing the law, maybe completing it by Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration or soonafter. But the repeal would not take effect until the future, perhaps a yearlater, to give lawmakers time to fashion a replacement. The version Obama vetoedhad a two-year delay.Vice President-elect Mike Pence said on "Fox News Sunday" that Trump "wants tofocus out of the gate on repealing Obamacare and beginning the process ofreplacing Obamacare."Because Republicans will control the Senate by just 52-48, Congress will firsthave to approve special budget procedures to prevent Democrats from stoppingrepeal legislation by filibuster. Bill-killing filibusters require 60 votes toend.
