NEW YORK - That electoral elephant in the room threatening political tensionthis Thanksgiving? StoryCorps believes it could be a unifying main course.The oral history project's "Great Thanksgiving Listen 2016" is urging Americans,particularly teens, to use the holiday weekend to record a conversation with agrandparent or another elder on their feelings about the election, their hopesand fears for the country and their thoughts on how to bring people together ina time of division.Dave Isay, StoryCorps' founder and president, said the project could strengthenties across the country when the chasm is deep."We're living in a moment where the divide is just so massive," and thediscussions will give people a chance to reflect on what happened in the lasttwo weeks, he said. "I can't think of anything more important right now thanlistening to each other and finding a way forward."StoryCorps debuted the Thanksgiving project last year, promptingintergenerational conversations, though without the election theme. The resultwas staggering: more than 50,000 recordings, as many as StoryCorps amassed inits first decade of operation combined.The "Great Thanksgiving Listen" is partnering with organizations including theAmerican Federation of Teachers and the National Education Association, as wellas school districts and educators in all 50 states, many of whom will assign aconversation to students. The hope is to meet or exceed the volume of recordingsfrom 2015.Anyone at least 13 years old is invited to take part in the "Great ThanksgivingListen" by downloading the StoryCorps app and inviting someone to take part.Isay said throughout StoryCorps' history, people have delved into the mostpersonal and tense moments of their lives: "We've never seen one of theseconversations go wrong."Stories have popped up around the country of people dreading a Thanksgivingspent with relatives with different political leanings than their own, and ofthe fraught political divide prompting some to skip the holiday altogether.StoryCorps conversations aren't aimed at diving into the particulars of thepolitical debate, but simply listening to the feelings of another. Because ofthat, and because the conversation is generally between two people who love andrespect each other, Isay said there's little risk of acrimony."They're not talking about political issues," he said, "they're talking aboutthe people they care about."StoryCorps was founded in 2003, and for most of its existence, participants wentto a recording booth to share their story. After winning a TED Prize last year,though, StoryCorps launched an app that allows people to record and upload theirconversations from anywhere, with the files being preserved by the Library ofCongress.Isay says his 13 years working on his brainchild have left him more hopeful thanever, and that this week's conversations could be an example across the country."It's time that the bubbles start to break and we start to listen to each otheragain and recognize how much we have in common," he said.
