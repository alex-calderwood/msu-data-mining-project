THE HAGUE, Netherlands - Populist anti-Islam lawmaker Geert Wilders delivered afiery closing statement Wednesday at his hate speech trial, slamming hisprosecution as a "charade, a disgrace for the Netherlands, a mockery for oursociety" that threatens freedom of speech.Wilders, whose party is riding high in Dutch opinion polls, told a three-judgepanel sitting in a heavily guarded courtroom on the outskirts of Amsterdam that,as an elected lawmaker, he must be able to talk about the "mega-Moroccanproblem" in the Netherlands and would not be muzzled by what he branded apolitical trial.In an address that sounded as much like a campaign speech ahead of DutchParliamentary elections due in March as a legal defense, Wilders cast himself aspart of a swelling global anti-establishment movement that already hasmanifested itself in the British vote to leave the European Union and DonaldTrump's victory in the U.S. presidential election.The politically charged prosecution centers on comments Wilders made before andafter the Dutch municipal elections in 2014. At one meeting in a Hague cafe, heasked supporters whether they wanted more or fewer Moroccans in the Netherlands.That sparked a chant of "Fewer! Fewer! Fewer!" - to which he replied "we'll takecare of it."Prosecutors say that Wilders, who in the past has been acquitted at another hatespeech trial for his outspoken criticism of Islam, overstepped the limits offree speech by specifically targeting Moroccans.But he insisted that the election night speech was in line with his FreedomParty's long-held policy ambitions of expelling criminals with Moroccannationality, reining in immigration and encouraging voluntary repatriation.The court will deliver its verdict and sentence Dec. 9. Prosecutors have askedjudges to convict Wilders and fine him 5,000 euros ($5,265).Earlier Wednesday, prosecutor Wouter Bos urged judges to reject arguments putforward by Wilders' lawyers that convicting the popular lawmaker would put theNetherlands on a slippery slope to totalitarianism.Wilders, in turn, harked back to his country's long history of free speech andtolerance as he called on judges to acquit him.
