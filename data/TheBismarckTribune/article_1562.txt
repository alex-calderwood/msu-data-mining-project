YUNDUM, Gambia - Gambia's newly elected president on Saturday vowed to free allpolitical prisoners and urged exiles who fled the 22-year reign of Yahya Jammehto return from abroad and help him reform the tiny West African country."A new Gambia is born," Adama Barrow said in an interview the day after hisupset election win. "We want everybody on board now. This is Gambia. Politics isover."A former businessman and now real estate mogul who became the unlikely head of aformidable opposition coalition, Barrow, 51, said he plans to preside during athree-year transition before another presidential election is held.He also said he planned to reverse Jammeh's decisions to pull out of both theCommonwealth, a group made up mostly of former British colonies, and theInternational Criminal Court, which prosecutes atrocities and other human rightsabuses.South Africa, Burundi and Gambia all previously announced plans to withdraw fromthe ICC, saying the court unfairly singles out African nations."The ICC is advocating for good governance. If you want to be part of that, Ithink there is no need for you to withdraw from the ICC," Barrow said.Raucous celebrations erupted Friday after Gambia's election commission announcedBarrow had won the Thursday vote, earning 45 percent of the total compared withJammeh's 36 percent.The streets were calmer on Saturday, but Gambians still were clearly excitedabout the pending transfer of power, marveling at the fact that Jammeh hadconceded defeat in a phone call aired on state television Friday night.Barrow, too, is optimistic about the future."I'm very happy because everybody thought that it was impossible, and theimpossible became possible," he said in the interview at his modest home east ofthe capital, Banjul.On Saturday, relatives, friends and coalition leaders gathered under trees outon the lawn, and Barrow was greeted with cheers, hugs and a local prayer singer.He said his two wives, five children and mother would join him in Gambia's StateHouse when he assumes office in January.While officially elected to a five-year term, Barrow noted that he has agreed toserve only three years with a goal of repairing Gambia's democracy before makingway for new leadership."When we get that done, then the foundation is there; and myself, I will not bein the political scene," he said.Barrow said he would prioritize reviving the country's stagnant economy andimproving its relationships within the international community.The United States was among the many countries critical of the human rightssituation under Jammeh, who stood accused of heading a government that torturedopponents and silenced all dissent.On Saturday, Secretary of State John Kerry congratulated Barrow on his win andnoted that his inauguration as president would mark Gambia's first democratictransfer of power."We call for unity and calm during this transition period," Kerry said.In addition to recommitting Gambia to the International Criminal Court, Barrowsaid his government would examine abuses under Jammeh while following dueprocess and administering justice that would not be "personal."He also promised reforms to the security forces, which were accused of manyabuses under Jammeh."We will improve their training to give them the professionalism to do theirjob," Barrow said. "With our government, they will be distanced from politics."
