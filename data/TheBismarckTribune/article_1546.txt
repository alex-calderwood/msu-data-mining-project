A divisive election that left half the countrydeflated and the other half rejuvenated could reverberate through the holidayshopping season in the gifts people give or how they spend.Some retailers say they have seen a surge in feel-good items such as spatreatments, candles and comfort food, while executives at some major retailerslike Wal-Mart, Target and Macy's have said there's no discernable shift inconsumer behavior since the presidential election won by Republican DonaldTrump.The divide in the outlook may reflect the rift in the election, as Americanssplit along geographic lines as well as by income."I don't need a comfort dog. I don't need anybody to feel sorry for me," saidRhondi Bleeker, 50, of Totowa, New Jersey. "I'm actually happy because I was forTrump."Bleeker, who owns an eyelash extension business, believes the economy will bebetter now. She says she'll still be spending the same $3,000 as she does everyholiday season, but she believes her business could do even better becausewhether people are sad or happy, most will want retail therapy.Crash revives debate over school bus seat belts in TennesseeNASHVILLE, Tenn.
