PARIS Â - Francois Fillon won France's first-ever conservative presidentialprimary Sunday after promising drastic free-market reforms and a crackdown onimmigration and Islamic extremism, beating a more moderate rival who had warnedof encroaching populism."President! President!" chanted the former prime minister's supporters as hedeclared victory over Alain Juppe in a nationwide runoff election.Polls suggest the 62-year-old Fillon, prime minister from 2007-2012 underex-President Nicolas Sarkozy, would have a good chance of winning the Frenchpresidency in the April-May election.Fillon campaigned on promises of slashing public spending, capping immigration,support for traditional family values and friendlier ties with Russian PresidentVladimir Putin. Fillon enjoyed a surprise surge in popularity in recent weeksover longtime front-runner Juppe, who also previously served as the country'sprime minister.In a sober victory speech, Fillon promised to defend "French values" and saidFrance needs "a complete change of software."Fillon, whom Juppe had accused of running a divisive campaign that catered tothe far right, struck a slightly more inclusive tone Sunday night.Juppe, 71, congratulated Fillon on his "wide victory." During the primarycampaign, he expressed similar ideas as his rival on the French economy, buttried to rally conservatives around a more tolerant attitude toward France'sethnic, religious and social diversity.Based on results from about 88 percent of polling stations, organizers of thecenter-right Republicans party primary said Fillon led with 67 percent of thevote compared to 33 percent for Juppe.Fillon's toughest challenge ahead is likely to be far-right leader Marine LePen. Le Pen is running an anti-establishment campaign that particularly targetsimmigrants, France's large Muslim minority, and the European Union.Socialist President Francois Hollande is expected to announce in the comingweeks whether he will seek re-election, but the French left has been deeplyweakened by Hollande's extreme unpopularity.Both Fillon and Juppe are high-profile leaders of the Republicans party whoknocked their former boss - former President Nicolas Sarkozy - out of theprimary's first round of voting a week ago. Sarkozy then threw his weight behindFillon.Sunday's runoff came after a bruising and highly adversarial end phase to themonths-long primary contest, an American-style effort to end party infightingand bolster support for the party's nominee.
