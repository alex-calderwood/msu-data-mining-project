Nikki Haley to serve as U.S. ambassador to the UnitedNations and prominent charter school advocate Betsy DeVos as his secretary ofeducationFULL TEXTPALM BEACH, Fla. >> Injecting the first diversity into his Cabinet-to-be, DonaldTrump selected two Republican women on Wednesday who disparaged him during thepresidential campaign: South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley to serve as U.S.ambassador to the United Nations and charter school advocate Betsy DeVos to leadthe federal Department of Education.Haley has little foreign policy experience, yet Trump praised her as "a provendealmaker." DeVos, like Trump, is new to government but has spent decadesworking to change America's system of public education.DeVos and Haley are the first women selected for top-level administration postsas the president-elect works to shape a White House team from scratch. Haley isthe daughter of Indian immigrants, so she also would be his first minorityselection after a string of announcements of white men.Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson said "an announcement is forthcoming" on hisrole, which would make him the first black choice - presumably as secretary ofHousing and Urban Development - but he also suggested he'd be thinking about itover the Thanksgiving holiday."I feel that I can make a significant contribution particularly to making ourinner cities great for everyone," Carson wrote on his Facebook page.Wednesday's picks came as Trump worked to distance himself from the "alt-right,"a movement of white supremacists who continue to cheer his election.He announced his two new choices in a statement released as he gathered withfamily behind closed doors at his Palm Beach estate for Thanksgiving. He'sspending the holiday there after a week of interviews of potential appointees inNew York, punctuated by announcements of members of his national security team.Bad blood between Trump and his new Cabinet selections was evident through muchof this year's campaign."The people of South Carolina are embarrassed by Nikki Haley!" Trump wrote inMarch. Haley denounced several of his campaign comments and urged voters to"reject the siren call of the angriest voices."DeVos told The Associated Press in July, "A lot of the things he has said arevery off-putting and concerning."On Wednesday, Trump said of his U.N. selection: "Gov. Haley has a proven trackrecord of bringing people together regardless of background or party affiliationto move critical policies forward for the betterment of her state and ourcountry."She said she loved her South Carolina post but "when the president believes youhave a major contribution to make to the welfare of our nation, and to ournation's standing in the world, that is a calling that is important to heed."While Republicans praised Haley's selection, DeVos faced criticism from left andright.The president of the National Education Association, Lily Eskelsen Garcia, saidin a statement that for years DeVos "has lobbied for failed schemes, likevouchers - which take away funding and local control from our public schools -to fund private schools at taxpayers' expense."And Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, tweeted,"Trump has chosen the most ideological, anti-public ed nominee since thecreation of the Dept of Education."At the same time, some conservatives warned that the longtime Republican donor,who has spent millions of dollars - along with her husband - to promotecandidates who favor charter schools and school vouchers, also supports theCommon Core education standards that Trump railed against during the campaign.Conservatives already were grappling with Trump's Tuesday concession thatclimate change may be connected to human activity and his reversal of a campaignvow to pursue a criminal investigation into Democratic rival Hillary Clinton.DeVos addressed criticism head-on, posting a "Q&A" statement that said directlyabout Common Core: "I am not a supporter - period.""I do support high standards," she said. But along the way Common Core "gotturned into a federal boondoggle."Just two weeks ago, Trump shocked the political world - including many in hisown party - by winning the presidential contest. The billionaire New Yorker hasyet to take any formal steps to separate from his international business empireas experts in both parties warn of potential conflicts of interest.Trump will be sworn into office in less than 60 days. Beyond his Cabinet, hemust fill hundreds of high-level administration posts.Spokesman Jason Miller said Trump now is focusing on his choice for secretary ofstate in particular. Among those under consideration: former New York Mayor andTrump loyalist Rudy Giuliani and 2012 GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney,formerly an outspoken Trump critic.After secretary of state, the U.N. ambassador is the highest-profile diplomaticposition, often serving as the voice for U.S. positions on the internationalstage.As for DeVos, her family has been active in Republican politics for decades,especially as donors. Her husband, Dick, is an heir to the Amway fortune and aformer president of the company.The American Federation for Children Action Fund, which DeVos chairs, and itsstate-affiliated PACs invested in 121 races in 12 states in the generalelection, spending $210,000 to support "pro-school choice" candidates inOklahoma alone."Under her leadership we will reform the U.S. education system and break thebureaucracy that is holding our children back so that we can deliver world-classeducation and school choice to all families," Trump said.DeVos said in her own statement, "The status quo in education is notacceptable."
