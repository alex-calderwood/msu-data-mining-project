By Katie LannanState House News ServiceBOSTON -- On the steps of the Statehouse on Monday, before a large crowd onBeacon Street, Harvard Law student Harmann Singh told a crowd that he was"aggressively accosted" in a store in Cambridge last week, followed around andscreamed at by a man who thought he was Muslim.Singh, who is a Sikh, said he shared that story to show that intolerance canhappen anywhere and that many Americans have felt unsafe in the days since theNov. 8 presidential election won by Republican Donald Trump, who defeatedDemocrat Hillary Clinton following a campaign marked by division and heatedrhetoric."The movement against such hate transcends political and personal identities,"Singh said during a rally attended by several of the state's top politicalfigures. "We must stand up against it collectively, no matter where or when itoccurs."The rally was held by the Anti-Defamation League and a coalition of 30 localgroups in response to what the organizers described as "an alarming number ofhate- and bias-fueled incidents across the country and in Massachusetts."Elected officials who spoke at the event called on ralliers to protect theirneighbors, oppose hatred and remain involved in the political process, whilepledging that state government would work to protect Massachusetts residents.Attorney General Maura Healey said a hotline her office established forresidents to report bias-motivated harassment and hate crimes has receivednearly 400 calls since its launch a week ago.Healey said that in the past two weeks, a Puerto Rican couple in WestSpringfield found the words "go home" keyed into their car, Ku Klux Klannewspapers were delivered to homes in Milford, and racist graffiti was found inan Attleboro High School bathroom.Though few speakers referred to President-elect Trump by name, Healey and stateTreasurer Deb Goldberg both criticized his recent Cabinet appointees, whichHealey called "really disturbing."The crowd booed as Goldberg named some of the appointees -- Republican NationalCommittee Chairman Reince Priebus, U.S. Sen. Jeff Sessions and Steve Bannon, whoheaded Trump's campaign."We cannot afford to wait and see," Goldberg said of the Trump administration,going on to reference a warning by Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel to "never befooled.""I'm not accusing anyone in particular of being an anti-Semite or beinganti-everyone, but I am accusing them of nurturing, mentoring, taking advantageof and feeding the underbelly of the animal for their own interests," Goldbergsaid.Gov. Charlie Baker, a Republican who was critical of Trump during thepresidential race, said last week there was "way too much prejudging going on"as Trump announced early Cabinet picks, and that he would follow PresidentBarack Obama's lead in waiting to judge the Trump administration "by thetotality of its appointments."Baker did not attend Monday's rally, which organizers attributed to a schedulingconflict, but sent a letter expressing his support."Our strength as a community lies in Massachusetts' diversity and openness tothe world. The commonwealth has been and always will be a welcoming state,"stated the letter, which was read at the event by Anti-Defamation League RobertTrestan, the Anti-Defamation League's regional director.Though all the elected officials who attended the rally were Democrats, BostonMayor Martin Walsh urged a bipartisan approach and called on attendees to seekout common ground."We should be tolerant of many different views," Walsh said. "We should respectthe democratic process, but we will not remain neutral when hate rears its uglyhead."House Speaker Robert DeLeo said it's the duty of state government to "protectall of our residents, no matter what is going on in Washington," and said thatwhile members of the House may disagree on policy matters, "we are united inopposing hatred and opposing intolerance."Senate President Stan Rosenberg read a statement that he said reflects "thesentiments of all 40 members of the Massachusetts Senate.""To those who feel threatened by recent events, be assured that our beliefremains steadfast: Everyone is entitled to the same rights and protections, andwe will stand by your side to uphold the law," the statement said.Other elected officials who attended included Reps. Lori Ehrlich, JonathanHecht, David Linsky, Daniel Cullinane, Byron Rushing and Daniel Ryan; Sens.Karen Spilka, Thomas McGee, Cynthia Creem and Linda Dorcena Forry; Sen.-electJulian Cyr; Suffolk County Sheriff Steven Tompkins; Suffolk District AttorneyDaniel Conley; and Boston City Councilors Josh Zakim and Matt O'Malley.
