First lady-to-be Melania Trump likely won't be wearing designer Tom Ford'sclothes in the White House.Some of the designers who clamored to dress first lady Michelle Obama have beenmixed about dressing Mrs. Trump, a former model. Ford became the latest to weighin on the matter during an appearance this week on "The View."The designer was asked to dress Melania Trump "quite a few years ago:" anddeclined because "she's not necessarily my image," he said on the ABC chat showWednesday.Ford was willing to dress first lady Michelle Obama for a London visit withQueen Elizabeth II in 2011 and isn't the first to be less enthusiastic aboutoutfitting Mrs. Trump.Sophie Theallat, whose designs have been worn by Mrs. Obama on severaloccasions, wrote in an open letter last month that she would not dress Mrs.Trump and specifically brought up politics in urging her colleagues to take thesame tact."The rhetoric of racism, sexism, and xenophobia unleashed by her husband'spresidential campaign are incompatible with the shared values we live by,"Theallat wrote.The letter prompted Women's Wear Daily , which covers the fashion industry, tosurvey other prominent designers on the question of working with Mrs. Trump.While Marc Jacobs said that he has "no interest whatsoever" in dressing Mrs.Trump, Tommy Hilfiger told the trade magazine he was willing, calling her "abeautiful woman who would make any designer's clothes look great."Melania Trump, wife of Republican Presidential Candidate Donald Trump walks tothe stage July 18 during the opening day of the Republican National Conventionin Cleveland.
