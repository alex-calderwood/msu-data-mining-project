WASHINGTON -- President-elect Donald Trump's charity has admitted that itviolated IRS regulations barring it from using its money or assets to benefitTrump, his family, his companies or substantial contributors to the foundation.The admissions by the Donald J. Trump Foundation were made in a 2015 tax filingmade public after a presidential election in which it was revealed that Trumphas used the charity to settle lawsuits, make a $25,000 political contributionand purchase items such as a painting of himself that was displayed at one ofhis properties.The filing's release, first reported by The Washington Post, comes as the NewYork attorney general's office investigates whether Trump personally benefitedfrom the foundation's spending.The filing also shows Trump's foundation accepted money from a Ukrainianbusinessman who also gave money to one of Trump's favored targets on thecampaign trail: The Clinton Foundation. The charity also donated to aconservative group that backed Trump during his candidacy.The 2015 tax filing was posted on the nonprofit monitoring website GuideStar onNov. 18 by someone using an email address from the foundation's law firm,Morgan, Lewis & Bockius, said GuideStar spokeswoman Jackie Enterline Fekeci.In the tax filing, the foundation acknowledged that it used money or assets inviolation of the regulations not only during 2015, but in prior years. But thetax filing doesn't provide details on the violations.Questions about the violations sent via email to Trump's transition team weren'timmediately answered Tuesday.Marcus S. Owens, a partner at the Washington law firm Loeb & Loeb and a formerdirector of the IRS exempt organizations division, said the lack of detail inthe tax filing makes it difficult to determine the extent of the charity'sviolations."There's no way to tell for sure whether the self-dealing is small and trivialor large and a pattern of ongoing deliberate misuse of the charity's assets,"Owens said.Generally, he said, self-dealing violations require the violator to pay anexcise tax equal to 10 percent of the amount involved in the transactions. Theviolator also would have to repay the foundation for the full amount involved.Owens also noted that self-dealing is a violation of New York state law, wherethe charity is registered.New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, a Democrat, launched aninvestigation into the charity after reporting by the Post drew attention tosome of the foundation's purchases, three of which are listed in the latestfiling: two portraits of Trump and a football helmet autographed by former NFLquarterback Tim Tebow.As the Post reported previously, Trump bid $12,000 for the football helmet, andhis wife, Melania, bid $20,000 for one of the portraits. The other portrait,which Trump bid $10,000 for, has been hanging on a wall at his golf course inDoral, Florida, according to the Post.Despite the high-dollar price tags, the foundation's latest tax filing nowvalues them at a combined $1,675. The tax filing does not specify if any of theitems are related to the self-dealing violations.The foundation has previously said it amended its tax filings after it gave animproper $25,000 check to a political committee supporting Florida AttorneyGeneral Pam Bondi in 2013.Charities are barred from engaging in political activities, and thepresident-elect's staff says the check he signed was mistakenly issued followinga series of clerical errors. Earlier this year, the Trump Foundation paid a$2,500 fine to the IRS over the check.The latest tax filing shows two Trump entities gave to his foundation, a breakfrom recent years when the foundation's donations came mostly from other donors.The Trump Corporation gave about $566,000 to the foundation, and TrumpProductions LLC, the company which produced "The Apprentice" and "CelebrityApprentice," gave $50,000 in 2015.Another large contributor was the foundation of Victor Pinchuk, a Ukrainianbillionaire who has advocated for closer relations between the European Unionand Ukraine. The Victor Pinchuk Foundation gave $150,000 to the Trump Foundationin 2015. Pinchuk's foundation has also given between $10 million and $25 millionto the Clinton Foundation.The Trump Foundation's tax filing shows that it also gave at least $10,000 toProject Veritas, a Trump-backing nonprofit group led by conservative activistJames O'Keefe.During the presidential campaign, O'Keefe's employees posed as would-beDemocratic donors and volunteers during a months-long ruse that captured oneDemocratic operative seeming to boast about his connections to Hillary Clinton'scampaign and claiming he hired people to provoke Trump rally-goers.The undercover sting prompted the Democratic Party and liberal groups to cutties with at least two operatives.
