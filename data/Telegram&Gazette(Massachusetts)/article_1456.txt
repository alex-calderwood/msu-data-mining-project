Wisconsin officials approved plansto begin a recount as early as Thursday. Stein also asked for a recount inPennsylvania and was expected to do the same in Michigan, where officialscertified Trump's victory Monday.Trump has angrily denounced the recounts and now claims without evidence thathe, not Clinton, would have won the popular vote if it hadn't been for "millionsof people who voted illegally." On Twitter, he singled out Virginia, Californiaand New Hampshire.There has been no indication of widespread election tampering or voter fraud inthose states or any others, and Trump aides struggled Monday to back up theirboss' claim.Spokesman Jason Miller said illegal voting was "an issue of concern." But theonly evidence he raised was a 2014 news report and a study on votingirregularities conducted before the 2016 election.-- The Associated PressMichigan vote certified for Trump but recount requests loomWASHINGTON -- Nearly three weeks after Election Day, Michigan officialscertified Monday that Donald Trump won the state by 10,704 votes out of nearly4.8 million to claim all of its 16 electoral votes. There's more wrangling tocome, though, on the final vote count for this oh-so-contentious campaign.Jill Stein's Green Party served notice that it would petition for a Michiganrecount even as her party pushed forward with recount efforts in Wisconsin andPennsylvania, where Trump won by somewhat wider but still small margins.Should the results for Trump hold in all three states, as expected, thepresident-elect would have 306 electoral votes to 232 for Democrat HillaryClinton. It takes 270 to be elected president.Only if the results were overturned in all three states would Clinton have aclaim on the presidency, and that is widely considered to be out of thequestion.If it's any consolation for Clinton -- and it's probably mighty little -- she'swinning the national popular vote. With some votes still being counted, she isahead by more than 2 million, about 1.5 percent of the total counted so far.-- The Associated Press
