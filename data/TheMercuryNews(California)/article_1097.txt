Reddit CEO and co-founder Steve Huffman said Wednesday that the tech firm willbe taking action against the social media sitecs cmost toxic usersc andapologized for how he handled abusive comments hurled at him.In a post on Reddit , Huffman wrote that the San Francisco tech firm will issuewarnings, timeouts and permanent bans for users that continually violate thesitecs rules. Posts from a popular pro-Donald Trump community calledcr/the_donaldc will also not appear on one of its main hubs called cr/all.ccI am sorry: I am sorry for compromising the trust you all have in Reddit, and Iam sorry to those that I created work and stress for, particularly over theholidays,c wrote Huffman, who goes by the user name spez on the site. cIt isheartbreaking to think that my actions distracted people from their family overthe holiday; instigated harassment of our moderators; and may have harmed Reddititself, which I love more than just about anything.cHuffman came under fire late last week cfor modifyingccomments made by users ina pro-Donald Trump discussion thread after they insulted and criticized him forallowing the tech firm to pull down a cPizzagatec conspiracy board from thesite.Reddit banned a community thread called cr/pizzagatec aimed at proving a falseconspiracy theory that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton andcampaign chairman John Podesta were running a child-trafficking ring out ofpizza restaurant Comet Ping Pong.Users part of a pro-Donald Trump discussion thread thought the companycsdecision to pull down cr/pizzagatec amounted to censorship and started postingcritical and profane comments about Huffman.The 33-year-old CEO changed some of the profane comments directed at him withthe user names of moderators from the Trump thread for about an hour.Social media companies such as Facebook and Twitter have also been trying to domore to crack down on online abuse, but Huffman made an unusual andcontroversial move by trying to ctroll the trollsc himself.cI honestly thought I might find some common ground with that community bymeeting them on their level. It did not go as planned. I restored the originalcomments after less than an hour, and explained what I did,c he wrote.An online petition asking that Huffman step down as CEO racked up more than5,300 signatures.cWhile many users across the site found what I did funny, or appreciated that Iwas standing up to the bullies (I received plenty of support from users ofr/the_donald), many others did not,c he wrote. cI understand what I did hasgreater implications than my relationship with one community, and it is fair toraise the question of whether this erodes trust in Reddit.cThe company is cupdating our internal controlsc to prevent him from modifyinguser comments in the future, Huffman wrote.Photo Credit:cReddit Logo
