By Lisa Riley RocheDeseret NewsSALT LAKE CITY - Mitt Romney continues to be seen as a top contender to serve assecretary of state in President- elect Donald Trump's new administration,despite their differences.Trump is "leaning toward" naming Mitt Romney to serve in the key post, The WallStreet Journal reported Tuesday, citing unnamed people familiar with thebillionaire businessman's deliberations.According to the newspaper, Trump's decision is being delayed by "an internaltug of war" between supporters of Romney and those backing former New York MayorRudy Giuliani, while others on the transition team want to continue the search.The newspaper said Trump views Romney - one of his harshest critics during thepresidential campaign - "as the prototypical choice to be the nation's topdiplomat," and that two people described the president-elect as "inclined toselect" Romney.CBS News reported Tuesday that a source close to the transition said Romneybecame "a serious contender" for the job after impressing Trump during theirmeeting Saturday.The network's source said Trump so enjoyed the meeting with Romney, the GOP's2012 presidential nominee, that he no longer has his "head wrapped around RudyGiuliani," a loyal supporter who has talked publicly about the high-profile job."It seems so improbable that it just might be true," said Jason Perry, head ofthe University of Utah's Hinckley Institute of Politics. "It's very clear whythis could be a good decision for Donald Trump."Perry said not only would choosing Romney as secretary of state help Trump withRepublicans who have yet to get behind the president-elect, it would also easesome of the concerns expressed by world leaders about the future of U.S. foreignpolicy.Because of the friction between the two men during the campaign, Perry saidselecting Romney would be seen as "bringing your most ardent critic into thehouse and sitting him at the table."Romney, who endeared himself to Utahns after taking over the troubled 2002Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, labeled Trump a "phony" and a "fraud" in aspeech last March at the University of Utah aimed at stopping Trump.Trump responded by referring to Romney as a "choke artist" and a "loser" whopleaded for Trump's endorsement in the 2012 presidential race. He evenquestioned whether Romney was really a Mormon.But after spending more than an hour with Trump, Romney told reporters theyshared "a far-reaching conversation with regard to the various theaters in theworld where there are interests of the United States of real significance."That conversation was widely reported as being about the position of secretaryof state. Vice President-elect Mike Pence, who sat in for part of thediscussion, called it "a very substantive meeting."Don Peay, Trump's top supporter in Utah and a close friend of the Trump family,said Romney is "absolutely" a possibility for secretary of state despite thetension that emerged during the campaign."That's what businessman do. You don't get caught up in the petty politics,"Peay said. "Trump's not going to play that game. They want the best and thebrightest, and the most capable."He said while he is not speaking for the new administration, he expects thatTrump will announce all of the national security-related posts, includingsecretary of state, by Dec. 1.Secretary of state isn't the only position that Romney could be underconsideration for, he said, because of his experience in the business world andas governor of Massachusetts."Mitt's a very talented businessman. He is a turnaround artist. I think there'sthree or four roles he could play," Peay said, including running Health andHuman Services or the Veterans Administration, entities that "need a majorrestructuring."Trump told a meeting of about two dozen anchors and executives from broadcastand cable networks on Monday that Romney "desperately wants" to be secretary ofstate, according to a report in The New Yorker."That sounds like you're going to give it to somebody else," said MatthewWilson, a political science professor at Southern Methodist University inDallas. Still, Wilson said, he believes Trump looked at Romney seriously."Otherwise, why would Trump meet with him? Trump doesn't need anything from MittRomney," Wilson said. "Giving him that position would signal that Trump iswilling to rise above personal animosity ... to be the bigger man."But that impression disappears if Trump doesn't find a role for Romney, he said.Just how well a Secretary of State Romney would fit into the Trumpadministration remains to be seen."A president and a secretary of state have to work together closely. It's prettyclear that Mitt Romney and Donald Trump are not temperamentally similar," Wilsonsaid, with Romney more methodical and Trump governing from the gut."That would probably over time drive Romney crazy," he said, especially giventhe delicate work of negotiating with other governments.Email: lisa@deseretnews.comTwitter: DNewsPolitics
