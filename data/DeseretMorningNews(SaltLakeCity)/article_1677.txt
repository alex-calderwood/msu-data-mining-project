By Lisa RileyRocheDeseret NewsSALT LAKE CITY - What's being billed as a "thank you" tour by President-electDonald Trump will make a stop in Utah, state GOP Chairman James Evans saidWednesday.Evans said he did not yet have a date for the event and could not say whetherTrump himself would make an appearance at the Utah stop. Trump is scheduled tokick off the tour Thursday with a rally in Cincinnati.The launch of the tour to states where Trump was victorious comes as thepresident-elect continues to consider whether to appoint Mitt Romney, one of hisharshest critics during the campaign, or another candidate as his secretary ofstate.The day after Romney joined Trump for a high-profile dinner in a posh New YorkCity restaurant, reporters were told during the daily media call from thepresident-elect's transition team there are still four "potential candidates"for the post.According to a transcript of the call in the Washington Post, RepublicanNational Committee spokesman Sean Spicer also said there is "no timetable set"for the decision, but no further Cabinet appointments are anticipated this week.Spicer did not name the candidates, but Romney, the GOP's 2012 presidentialnominee; former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani; former CIA Director DavidPetraeus; and Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., have all been previously identified.Romney, who labeled Trump a "fraud" and a "phony" in a March speech at theUniversity of Utah aimed at keeping the billionaire businessman from winning theprimary election, praised him after Tuesday's dinner, their second meeting.He said Trump "continues with a message of inclusion and bringing peopletogether, and his vision is something which obviously connected with theAmerican people in a very powerful way."Trump last appeared in Utah in March, just before he came in a distant thirdplace in the state's presidential preference caucus vote. He sent his runningmate, now Vice President-elect Mike Pence, to rally Utah Republicans in October.Evans told KSL Newsradio's Doug Wright on Wednesday that Trump "really is fondof Utah. I think this is a great opportunity to bring Republicans together" sothe campaign can express its gratitude for his victory in the state.While Trump was statistically tied shortly before the election with DemocratHillary Clinton and independent conservative candidate Evan McMullin, he endedup winning Utah with 45.5 percent of the vote.Trump struggled with voters in a state so reliably Republican it had not votedfor a Democrat for president since 1964, especially after a 2005 video surfacedof him talking in graphic terms about making sexual advances on women.Some GOP leaders, including Gov. Gary Herbert, backed off their support fortheir party's presidential pick. A few never endorsed Trump, but most did followPence's urging that they "come home" to the nominee.University of Utah political science professor Matthew Burbank said it's notclear how a "thank you" visit from Trump would be received in a state where hecouldn't muster a majority of the votes."I would guess he would not get as warm a welcome here as he would otherplaces," Burbank said. "I think the message from Utah was this is a veryRepublican place ... but there just wasn't a lot of enthusiasm for Trump."Utah Democratic Party Chairman Peter Corroon said the Trump team's tour may be agood idea because "frankly, he offended a lot of people during the presidentialelection cycle, so this could be an opportunity for him to make amends."Email: lisa@deseretnews.comTwitter: DNewsPolitics
