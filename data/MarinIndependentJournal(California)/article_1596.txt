But because of the margin ofvictory - and the degree of apparent foreign interference during the campaign -Elias said that Clinton officials had "quietly taken a number of steps in thelast two weeks to rule in or out any possibility of outside interference in thevote tally in these critical battleground states."He said that the Clinton campaign will participate in the Stein-initiatedrecount in Wisconsin by having representatives on the ground monitoring thecount and having lawyers represent them in court if needed. And if Stein makesgood on efforts to prompt similar processes in Pennsylvania and Michigan, Eliassaid, the Clinton campaign would do so there, as well."The campaign is grateful to all those who have expended time and effort toinvestigate various claims of abnormalities and irregularities," Elias said."While that effort has not, in our view, resulted in evidence of manipulation ofresults, now that a recount is underway, we believe we have an obligation to themore than 64 million Americans who cast ballots for Hillary Clinton toparticipate in ongoing proceedings to ensure that an accurate vote count will bereported."Trump's reactionThe recount effort is somewhat unusual in that it comes weeks after Clintonconceded - and at the request and with the financial backing of a third-partycandidate, Stein, who has no chance of winning, said election-law expert RichardHasen, a law professor at the University of California at Irvine. Clinton, too,has virtually no chance of altering the result, given that she would have toreverse not just Wisconsin but also Michigan and Pennsylvania to becomepresident, Hasen said.In a statement, Trump said the recount was "just a way for Jill Stein, whoreceived less than one percent of the vote overall and wasn't even on the ballotin many states, to fill her coffers with money" and said the election resultsshould be "respected instead of being challenged and abused, which is exactlywhat Jill Stein is doing.""The people have spoken and the election is over, and as Hillary Clinton herselfsaid on election night, in addition to her conceding by congratulating me, 'Wemust accept this result and then look to the future,' " Trump said.For her part, Stein took to Twitter to question Clinton's motives forparticipating in the recount effort."Why would Hillary Clinton - who conceded the election to Donald Trump - want#Recount2016?" Stein wrote. "You cannot be on-again, off-again about democracy."Change doubtfulRecounts can change outcomes. Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn., famously defeated NormColeman for the seat he now holds after a months-long recount and legal battle,even though Coleman seemed initially to have a lead. But the margins are usuallyin the hundreds, not thousands, and typically recounts are initiated bycandidates in close races refusing to accept defeat, as is the case in the NorthCarolina gubernatorial race between incumbent Pat McCrory (R) and Democrat RoyCooper, Hasen said."I don't think there's any realistic chance whatsoever that even if recounts aredone in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, that's going to change the outcomein the states, or in the presidential election generally," Hasen said.Trump won 1,404,000 votes in Wisconsin, according to the state's electioncommission, while Clinton had 1,381,823. The Wisconsin recount will be conductedby county boards of canvassers, who must move quickly to meet a mid-Decemberdeadline to ensure the state's electoral votes are counted. Stein has to file byMonday to prompt a recount in Pennsylvania, and by Wednesday to trigger arecount in Michigan. The results in that state are not technically certifieduntil Monday.The presidential campaign was marked by fears that Russian hacking might affectthe outcome, especially after the hackers penetrated the computer network of theDemocratic National Committee and were found to have attempted intrusions onvoter registration databases. The Washington Post also recently reported, citingresearchers who tracked the phenomenon, that Russians created and spread fakenews about the election with the apparent goal of helping Trump.Questions raisedDuring the campaign, Clinton criticized Trump for refusing to say that he wouldaccept the election results if she won. Asked during an October debate whetherhe would do so, Trump responded that he would "keep you in suspense." Clintoncalled that answer "horrifying" and said Trump was "talking down our democracy."In recent days, though, it is Clinton's supporters who have raised questionsabout the outcome of the election. A viral post spread by some Clinton backers,including actress Debra Messing, suggested - falsely - that the JusticeDepartment was "tallying calls" from people who wanted an audit of the 2016election and urged people to make their displeasure known."Even if it's busy, keep calling," one version said. "We should not back downfrom this."New York magazine reported that Clinton was being urged "by a group of prominentcomputer scientists and election lawyers" to call for a recount in Wisconsin,Michigan and Pennsylvania, and the group had some evidence of possibly unusualactivity. That fueled more skepticism and calls for action by Clintonsupporters.The evidence of possible malfeasance, though, was limited. According to New Yorkmagazine, the group found that Clinton "received 7 percent fewer votes incounties that relied on electronic-voting machines compared with counties thatused optical scanners and paper ballots," and that based on that "statisticalanalysis, Clinton may have been denied as many as 30,000 votes; she lostWisconsin by 27,000."Clinton probeJ. Alex Halderman, one of the academics reportedly involved, later wrote onMedium that the deviations were "probably not" the result of a cyberattack, butthat "the only way to know whether a cyberattack changed the result is toclosely examine the available physical evidence - paper ballots and votingequipment in critical states like Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania."Posting a link to a New York Times story about Clinton supporters calling for arecount, senior Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway said, "Look who 'can't accept theelection results.' "Elias's post might fuel similar criticism. Notably, though, Clinton did notinitiate the recount herself; Stein did, after raising millions of dollars tofund the effort and claiming this had been a "hack-riddled election." Elias saidthat the campaign had not planned to ask for a recount itself because it hadfound no actionable evidence of hacking.The Clinton campaign had investigated the matter extensively. Elias said thecampaign had "lawyers and data scientists and analysts combing over the resultsto spot anomalies" and had also "monitored and staffed the post-electioncanvasses - where voting machine tapes are compared to poll-books, provisionalballots are resolved, and all of the math is double-checked from electionnight." He said the campaign also met with outside experts and "attempted tosystematically catalogue and investigate every theory that has been presented tous within our ability to do so."
