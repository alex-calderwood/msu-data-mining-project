"But as a loss for the Democratic Party."The event, held in Dominican University's Angelico Hall in conjunction withCorte Madera's Book Passage, was designed to promote Sanders' new book, "OurRevolution: A Future to Believe In." Sanders barely mentioned the book, however.As he did during his bid for the Democratic presidential nomination, Sandersconcentrated instead on the issue that has energized him throughout hispolitical career: economic inequality. He said he doesn't believe that all ofthe people who voted for Trump are racists or sexists or homophobes."I don't believe that at all,"Sanders said. "I think a lot of people ended up holding their noses and votingfor Trump because they are in pain."He provided a few choice examples of that pain. For example, he noted the factthat millions of Americans still lack health insurance and that many people withinsurance have high deductibles that discourage them from seeing a doctor andcan't afford the medicine they're prescribed if they do consult a physician.Sanders said that half of people age 55 have no money saved for retirement, thaton average men in West Virginia's affluent Fairfax County live 18 years longerthan men in the state's economically disadvantaged McDowell County, and thattens of thousands of people living in Baltimore, Maryland, are addicted toheroin."There are a lot of people in our country who are hurting and they are hurtingvery, very badly," Sanders said." The political establishment is not hearingtheir pain; the financial and economic establishment could care less about theirlives; and the media establishment is not dealing with the reality of theirlives; and along comes Mr. Trump."But Sanders said voters who believed Trump when he told them he was going tomake their lives better are going to be disappointed."It appears we're going to be governed by tweets, a new form of government, 140characters or less, and there we go," Sanders said.For people who are distressed by Trump's election, Sanders had some disturbingnews: things could get worse if campaign finance laws are weakened further."The reality is that this country both politically and economically is movingtoward an oligarchic form of society where a small number of very wealthy andpowerful people control our economy and our political life," Sanders said."So what we have to do," Sanders said, "is create a strong grassroots movementwhere we bring people together to fight not only for social justice, not onlyfor environmental justice, but for economic justice as well. But here is whereit becomes difficult."It is very easy for many Americans to say, I hate racism, I hate homophobia, Ihate sexism," Sanders said, "but it is a little bit harder for people in themiddle or upper middle class to say, maybe we do have to deal with the greed ofWall Street."One of the things I'm trying to do," Sanders said, "is to figure out a way toradically transform the Democratic Party from a party led by a liberal elite toa party led by working people and young people and people who really want totransform society."If attendance at Sanders' book tour appearances is any indication, he will haveno trouble recruiting foot soldiers in his bid to revamp the Democratic Party.Karen West, Book Passage's events director, said tickets to the San Rafael eventsold out in six hours and the store stopped adding names to the waiting listwhen it reached 700. Earlier Friday, Sanders spoke to about 2,000 people duringa sold-out appearance at UC Berkeley's Zellerbach Auditorium."He's the guy I find that is speaking the truth. He really cares about thepeople," said Richard Ehret of Sausalito, 70, who attended the San Rafael eventwith his daughter and a group of her friends."I'm a supporter of Bernie's, and I voted for him. I like how he's really forthe people," said Analisa Duharte, 18, a Dominican University freshman."I wanted to find out how we're going to survive the age of Trump and maintain aprogressive agenda," said Rendell Bower of San Rafael, who attended the eventwith his partner, Lisa Haydon, who said she supported Hillary Clinton."I supported the person who was most likely to win," Haydon said."Unfortunately, I guessed wrong."
