Mitt Romney,"Conway said. "He went out of his way to hurt Donald Trump."She added that it was unclear whether Romney had even voted for Trump.Romney, the former Massachusetts governor and 2012 GOP presidential candidate,was a fierce and vocal critic of Trump throughout his campaign.

And the federation's survey found that about 122million people plan to shop on Cyber Monday, up from 121 million last year.- IJ news reports
