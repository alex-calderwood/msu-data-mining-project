BIRMINGHAM, Ala. >> Donald Trump's election is bringing to the fore a strain ofrace-based politics once so far out of the mainstream few had even heard of it.With an ideology that's a mix of racism, white nationalism and old-fashionedpopulism, the "alt-right" has burst into the collective consciousness sincemembers showed up at the Republican National Convention to celebrate Trump'snomination last summer.When one of its leaders, Richard Spencer, gave a speech in Washington lastSaturday at an alt-right conference attended by a couple of hundred people, TheAtlantic was there with a video camera that captured the Nazi-style salutes ofpeople."Hail Trump, hail our people, hail victory!" Spencer said to cheers that wereshown in video snippets that have since been viewed.What does Spencer mean by "our people"? Whites. Spencer directs the NationalPolicy Institute, which describes itself as "dedicated to the heritage, identityand future of people of European descent in the United States and around theworld."It is Spencer who is widely credited with coming up with the term "alt-right,"or "alternative-right," about eight years go.While members of the movement are getting more attention than ever, the head ofthe Anti-Defamation League's Center on Extremism said Tuesday there is not muchnew in its message."The hatred and bigotry that is at the core of alt-right ideology has notchanged," center director Oren Segal said in an interview conducted by privatemessaging. "What has changed is the name, their packaging and the stated beliefthat they have a champion in the highest office."Richard Cohen, president of the Alabama-based Southern Poverty Law Center, anorganization that tracks hate groups, said the alt-right is "a rebranding ofwhite nationalism." Cohen called it "the energy behind the avalanche of racistand anti-Semitic harassment that plagued social media platforms for the entirepresidential campaign."Cohen's comments came in a statement about Trump's decision to fill his chiefstrategist slot with Steve Bannon, who formerly ran Breitbart News, a websitepopular with members of the alt-right. Indeed, much of the alt-right existsonline only, for all practical purposes.While the Ku Klux Klan or neo-Nazis might have public rallies, people associatedwith the alt-right are more likely to spread their beliefs in online forums oron social media like Twitter.They tend more toward memes than marches; subjects can include criticism ofJews.Trump aides and advisers have tried to distance him from the beliefs of thealt-right. In a meeting Tuesday with editors and reporters of The New YorkTimes, Trump said of the alt-right: "I don't want to energize the group, and Idisavow the group."
