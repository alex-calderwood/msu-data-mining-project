EliasSECTION: A,A; Pg. 7LENGTH: 713 wordsIf you voted this fall in a neighborhood garage or the clubhouse of a park or aschool auditorium, remember the experience well. It may not be repeated anytimesoon. If you saw American flags flying at your precinct polling place, thatsight may also disappear.A whole new election system is about to begin in California, complete with "votecenters" and a big expansion of early balloting. The new system will startphasing in in 2018 in 14 counties and should be operative by 2020 everywhere inthe state.One thing is for sure: Losing candidates and those who expect to lose will havenew fodder for the "rigged election" cry taken up so vocally this fall byRepublican presidential candidate Donald Trump. With more mail-in ballotsinvolved than ever before, same-day voter registration and personnel in place toprovide language assistance, charges of fraud will be common at least while thenew system is being broken in.The hope behind the new system, pushed hard by Democratic Secretary of StateAlex Padilla and signed into law by Gov. Jerry Brown, is to increase voterturnout drastically.After low turnout disappointed officials in 2014 and the off-year elections of2013 and 2015, they began casting about for changes. The new system will delivermail-in ballots to every registered voter in the 28 days before the actualElection Day, aiming to end any need to vote in a single place on just one day."We've got to ... implement a new voting model," said Democratic state Sen. BenAllen of Santa Monica, who sponsored the new system in the Legislature. "Ourcurrent system has failed, as our voter turnout rates continued to declinetoward record lows."Turnout in both the 2014 primary (25 percent of registered voters) and thatyear's November general election (42 percent) was at record lows, making Padillaand the Legislature a bit desperate to push numbers up.So instead of voters needing to sign up to receive mail-in ballots for everyelection, from now on they will go to everyone automatically. Never mind thetradition of the secret ballot; everyone from labor unions to employers toneighborhood groups is now free to hold ballot-marking parties before ElectionDay. This has actually been true since mail-in voting became common in the late1970s, and there have never been charges it led to mass fraud or coerced votingfor particular candidates or causes. But such outcries may arise now.The guinea pigs for the new system will be voters in Calaveras, Inyo, Madera,Napa, Nevada, Orange, Sacramento, San Luis Obispo, San Mateo, Santa Clara,Shasta, Sierra, Sutter and Tuolumne counties, with in-person voting at centersspotted around each county weeks before Election Day. Voters also will be ableto drop off ballots at those centers, rather than mailing them in.Counties pushed for this, partly as a cost-cutting measure. The fewer pollingplaces, the lower the cost of an election. But counties moving to the new systemwill all have to adopt detailed plans through a system involving public hearingsand input. Community groups, advocates for the disabled and other individualsall will be able to express preferences for vote center locations. But expectthem to be placed in public buildings where there's either no rent or low rent.The politicians behind this system claim it will provide far greater flexibilitythan long-standing precinct polling places. "It's time to modernize the votingprocess," said Democratic state Sen. Robert Hertzberg of Van Nuys, a co-sponsor."We need to provide the same convenience and flexibility (people) have in otherareas of their lives. You can stream a movie or deposit a check with your phoneany time, but without this (change), people still have to arrange their busyschedules to get to a polling place on a single day and that has hurt turnout."Only time will tell whether all this actually spurs more people to vote. And noone knows whether the inevitable charges of fraud or vote-fixing will have anymerit. But the people behind the change are certainly correct about one thing:Turnout had become far too low in recent years, often allowing a small minorityof eligible voters to choose the people who make key decisions for everyone.Thomas D.
