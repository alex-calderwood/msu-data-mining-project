EliasSECTION: A,A; Pg. 8LENGTH: 715 words"The pundits like to slice and dice our country into red states and bluestates," Barack Obama famously observed in 2004, several years before he ran forpresident. "But I've got news for them: There's the United States of America."Twelve years later, Obama is about to depart the White House, and by now he hasprobably learned there are significant differences between so-called "red"states that tend to vote Republican in presidential elections and "blue" onesthat usually support Democrats. The colors, of course, come from maps often usedas television graphics during election coverage.What are some of those differences? While campaigning - at least before DonaldTrump - Republicans have tended to focus on values, claiming families andtraditional marriages are stronger in red states than blue ones, while Democratscontend poor people, minorities and women are better off in blue ones.California, of course, has been a consistently blue state since 1992, when BillClinton carried it with a plurality of the vote against the elder George Bush,not winning an actual majority here until 1996.Republicans often say California Democrats have wrecked the Golden State overthe last 25 years, citing what they insist is a declining quality of life and anexpanded role for government.It's true Democrats have dominated the Legislature almost all that time, passinglaws that regulate everything from cellphone use in cars to teaching about gayhistory in high schools. A "nanny state," many Republicans call it, ignoring thefact Republican governors like Pete Wilson and Arnold Schwarzenegger signed offon most of the new regulations Democrats passed in the last quarter-century.Ethnically speaking, California became blue when its Latinos began to getpolitically active. But in many other ways, this is statistically a prettystandard blue state, and there are major differences between those states andtheir red rivals. Here are some (based on U.S. Census data):o Blue states tend to have a more educated populace; California is fairlytypical with 37.4 percent of adults holding college degrees. Deeply blueMassachusetts (despite its Republican governor) ranks first in this categorywith 53.4 percent of adults holding at least a bachelor's degree. At the bottomin this category is a corps of red states including Alaska at 26.6 percent,Texas at 32.2 percent and Arizona with 33 percent.o Red states tend to have a far higher percentage of people abusing drugs, ledby West Virginia with 25.8 persons out of every 100,000 dying of drug overdoseseach year, Utah with 18.4 and Alaska 18.1 in 2008, the last year for whichstatistics are available. Red states like Louisiana, Arizona, Alabama, Oklahomaand Tennessee all topped 14 per 100,000 in this sad category. California, againin drug abuse a fairly normal blue state, saw only 10.4 persons out of every100,000 take fatal overdoses, both from illegal drugs and prescription ones.(Statistics from the Policy Impact Report of the Centers for Disease Control andPrevention.)o A little counterintuitive, the map of states with the highest Census-reporteddivorce rates is also almost all red, including Oklahoma, Arkansas, Alaska,Alabama, Kentucky, Nevada (the only blue state here, but also the only statewith an active quickie divorce industry), Mississippi, Georgia, Tennessee andArizona.o Unemployment, on the other hand, is a mixed bag. In the latest Department ofLabor statistics, three red states (Alaska, Louisiana and West Virginia) areamong the top six, with Alaska leading the unfortunate way at 6.7 percent, butthey are joined by three usually blue states (Illinois, New Mexico and theDistrict of Columbia).o Red state citizens tend to be more charitable, with the eight states donatingthe highest share of their personal income to charity - Utah, Mississippi,Alabama, Tennessee, South Carolina, Idaho, Arkansas and Georgia - all prettyreliably Republican. (Data from the Chronicle of Philanthropy.)All of which raises some questions: Do Republican "family values" equate tohigher divorce rates and lower college education? Does going Democratic makepeople less charitable? Or are none of these things linked to politics at all?Thomas D. Elias is a writer in Southern California. tdelias@aol.com
