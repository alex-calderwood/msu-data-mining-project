No column sig. No pullquote.FULL TEXTVirtually every aspect of the presidential election has been broken down andanalyzed by experts and pundits, who are still in a state of shock over theresults. Because President-elect Donald Trump's victory caught almost everyoneby surprise, don't expect this analysis to slow down any time soon.Getting lost in the shuffle were many of the down-ballot races that alsoproduced fascinating results.Take for example, the contest to see who would replace retiring U.S. Sen.Barbara Boxer as California's junior senator.All of the public polls had Golden State Attorney General Kamala Harriscomfortably ahead of Orange County Congresswoman Loretta Sanchez in the Democratvs. Democrat match up. And I think it's safe to say that most expertsanticipated a comfortable Harris victory. What nobody expected was the 62-38percent shellacking that Sanchez ended up taking.There is no way to sugarcoat this, she got creamed.Now, I'd be lying to you if I didn't say that the perennially undisciplinedSanchez made a bunch of gaffes that contributed to her defeat.She did.But her missteps aren't what caused her to lose. The cake, in many ways, wasalready baked.Way back in July, the bigwigs in the Northern California-dominated CaliforniaDemocratic Party put the word out that Harris was their preferred candidate.This move effectively cut off any chance Sanchez had at raising money, winninginfluential endorsements and getting the party rank and file behind her.Not only did Harris pick up the endorsements of California Gov. Jerry Brown andthe California Democratic Party, she also got the blessing of President Obamaand Vice President Joe Biden.In a written statement released by the Harris campaign, the president and vicepresident said, "Kamala Harris fights for us. That's why I'm so proud to endorseher for United States senator. ... And if you send her to the Senate, she'll bea fearless fighter for the people of California - all the people of California -every single day."There's mass speculation that former San Francisco Mayor and current CaliforniaLt. Gov. Gavin Newsom could get the same kind of home cooking in his bid forgovernor in 2018.And If another former San Francisco Mayor, Dianne Feinstein, decides to seekanother six-year-term in the U.S. Senate in 2018, her support within theDemocratic Party will surely be locked down.The most likely outcome is that the Northern California dominance of the state'stop-of-the-ticket offices will continue for another generation.How did this happen when most of the state's population lives south ofBakersfield? Easy. A clique of San Francisco Bay politicians control theDemocratic Party in a one-party state, and they take care of their friends andneighbors.Just look at the roster; Jerry Brown is a former mayor of Oakland, HouseMinority Leader Nancy Pelosi represents San Francisco in Congress, CaliforniaDemocratic Party Chairman John Burton used to represent San Francisco in thestate Legislature, and Democratic Party sugar daddy Tom Steyer resides in theCity by the Bay.At a certain point, Southern California Democrats will have to accept thereality that they've hit their political ceiling when they become a big-citymayor or congressman, or a state legislative leader.Or, they're going to have to beat the machine.Option B is easier said than done and would require the type ofcoalition-building that Sanchez was incapable of doing, which would almostcertainly involve California Republicans.Eventually, some politician will beat the machine. The only question is when.John Phillips is a CNN political commentator and can be heard weekdays at 3 p.m.on "The Drive Home with Jillian Barberie and John Phillips" on KABC/AM 790.
