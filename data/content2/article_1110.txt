HIGHLIGHT: Community bankers overwhelmingly supported Donald J. Trump'scampaign. Now, as mega-banks' stock soars, they too are looking ahead to thebenefits of his administration.Washington lobbyists, financial and policy analysts and Wall Street insiders areall trying to figure out what the Trump administration will mean for the bankingindustry.But Rusty Cloutier never doubted that Mr. Trump would be good for the small bankhe runs in Lafayette, La.Mr. Cloutier sees in the new administration a chance not just for regulatoryrelief, but for a reordering of priorities away from the wealthy interests ofthe big cities and toward the rural and blue-collar communities where heoperates."My customers are very hard-working people," said Mr. Cloutier, the president ofMidSouth Bank. "They work in the oil fields and they hear they are racist, andthey just got tired of it being slammed in their face."He added, "Tell your editors that they need to run a headline that says 'MainStreet Won.'"And yet, in the weeks since Mr. Trump's surprise election, Wall Street has beenwinning, too.The stocks of Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase have been soaring to theirhighest levels in years - a rally of such force that it has caught many bankexecutives and analysts by surprise.The surge, for example, has more than restored all the value in Wells Fargo'sshare price that was eroded after the scandal over the rampant creation ofunauthorized bank accounts erupted in September.For now, banks both large and small are benefiting from expectations that thepresident-elect will roll back regulations on just about every aspect of theindustry, including the fees banks can charge, whom they can lend to and howmuch capital they have to hold.Banks would also benefit from the higher interest rates that are expected if aTrump administration's fiscal stimulus program revives inflation. Higher rateswould increase the value of some of the banks' holdings and would widen banks'margins on loans.But like nearly all of Mr. Trump's policy positions, his plan for bankingregulation has not been explained in any great detail. Mr. Trump's feelings onbanks, perhaps more so than other industries, are difficult to sort out.On one hand, he has called for dismantling the 2010 Dodd-Frank financialoverhaul that is credited with reining in risk taking but blamed for crimpingprofits. On the other, he has railed against Wall Street elites for keeping downsmall-town America.How, then, will Mr. Trump justify policies that bolster bank profits, while alsodelivering on his promises of economic populism?Community bankers see themselves in the sweet spot. They say Mr. Trump can limitregulations - particularly on banks with less than $10 billion in assets - whilestill being tough on the Wall Street banks that were the driver of the financialcrisis and so much anger among the general public.Freeing up community banks from the qualified mortgage rule and rigorousanti-money laundering guidelines, for example, would allow them to spend lesstime and resources complying with regulation and more on making loans andlifting the fortunes of the rural America Mr. Trump championed in his campaign.Several community bankers said they also wanted the Trump administration to reinin the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau by installing a five-personbipartisan oversight board, rather than a single director.Among community bankers, support for Mr. Trump has been pervasive andconsistent.Roughly 84 percent of community bankers supported Mr. Trump, according to a pollthat the industry's trade group conducted after the political conventions thissummer."I didn't have any Trump signs in my yard," said Tim Zimmerman, president ofStandard Bank, which operates in communities outside Pittsburgh. "But I want thebank to do well and to be able to help people in the community. And I can't dothat if things go the way they are going."In reality, the nation's roughly 5,800 community banks represent a relativelysmall part of America's banking activity. About half of the nation's depositsare held by just a handful of mega-banks, where there was deep support forHillary Clinton.Many on Wall Street helped bankroll Mrs. Clinton's campaign in the hope that shewould protect the forces that drive their global profits, like free trade. Manyexecutives at large banks feared that Mr. Trump was a loose cannon who coulddestabilize the economy.The chief executive of Goldman Sachs, Lloyd C. Blankfein, went so far as topublicly voice support for Mrs. Clinton. He made a cameo in a pro-Trump ad -along with Janet L. Yellen, the chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, and theinvestor George Soros - that painted the Democrats as puppets of the globalfinancial elite. Critics called the ad anti-Semitic because it focused on Jewishfigures.But as the stock market soared, the big banks began talking about the upside ofa Trump presidency. Two days after the election, Mr. Blankfein said at theDealBook conference sponsored by The New York Times that he believed Mr. Trump'spolicies would be "market supportive."Unprepared for a Trump victory, executives inside the big banks began drawing uplists of regulations or rules that the new administration and theRepublican-controlled Congress might change for their benefit.They are not arguing for the repeal of Dodd-Frank, which large banks have spenthundreds of millions of dollars complying with.Nor do they want a less powerful consumer protection agency, which some creditwith helping big banks by cracking down on players on the industry's margins,like payday lenders.At the top of their wish list: rolling back the so-called Durbin Amendment,which limits the fees banks can charge on debit cards, and tweaking the VolckerRule so that large banks can engage in more types of trading activity to helptheir clients.As banking lobbyists seek inroads with the new administration over regulation,Democrats are trying to pressure the industry to denounce other actions by Mr.Trump, including his selection of Stephen K. Bannon as his chief strategist. Theformer executive chairman of the Breitbart News Network, Mr. Bannon has beencriticized for inflaming racist and xenophobic views.In a letter last week, Representative Maxine Waters of California, the rankingmember of House Financial Services Committee, and other Democrats said thebanking industry had a "moral obligation to speak out against this appointmentas contrary to the values of this country and to the values of your industry."The banking groups are declining to weigh in. Some say their input is notrelevant because Mr. Bannon is not likely to have a direct role in regulatingthe financial industry."Personally, I don't think he is a racist," Scott McComb, chief executive ofHeartland Bank, which operates across Central Ohio, said of the president-elect."I think it is propaganda that is made to make him look bad."Mr. McComb said while Mr. Trump said things during the campaign "that are notbecoming of a president," he expected that Mr. Trump would act with more decorumin the White House."He conducted himself like a New York City developer," during the campaign, Mr.McComb said. "That is how a New York City developer acts."Mr. Cloutier, the Louisiana banker, said even if Mr. Trump appointed someonelike Steven Mnuchin, the former Goldman executive, to a top economic post, thepresident-elect would not forget his promises to working-class America - and byextension small banks."He's not going to be taking care of the sugar daddies who look down on thehardworking people of America," Mr. Cloutier said. "But if he don't deliver onthat, he won't be around four years from now."PHOTOS: Rusty Cloutier, above, president of MidSouth Bank in Louisiana.
