It's highly unlikely Merrill Lynch would reverse its position on scrapping IRAcommissions if the Labor Department's fiduciary rule were to be repealed underDonald Trump's administration, according to industry watchers.Marketing plays a large role in this analysis, they say. As the first wirehouseto announce compliance plans for the regulation, which affects investment advicein retirement accounts, Merrill Lynch has heavily promoted its wholesale shiftto advisory fees over brokerage commission as being in clients' best interests.Merrill Lynch started a print, digital and social media campaign in earlyNovember titled "We're committed to your best interest. Not the status quo." Init, the firm said that it believes in having a "fair, transparent fee before westart any work" and that it would not collect commissions on personal retirementaccounts."We believe we are honoring the spirit of the new [fiduciary] rules - notlooking for ways to get around them," the ad said. "Since Charlie Merrillstarted this company, we have always been committed to our clients. Not thestatus quo.""I think they are probably trapped in a way the other firms are not," said DannySarch, founder and owner of Leitner Sarch Consultants, a recruiting firm."They've used this as a marketing strategy. For them to reverse course isprobably more challenging than for other firms that have not been so public, Ã la Commonwealth."Since the U.S. presidential election, stakeholders have voiced a variety ofopinions on the fate of the fiduciary rule, with some saying it is safe fromrepeal and others sounding off on its likely demise through a variety ofstrategies.COMMONWEALTHExecutives at Commonwealth Financial Network, an independent broker-dealer thatfollowed Merrill Lynch in announcing a shift away from commission retirementaccounts upon the rule's taking effect in April, recently indicated they wouldreverse that decision if the rule were killed.In the meantime, Commonwealth is moving ahead with its compliance schedule andits previously announced business changes, according to a statement.Merrill Lynch spokeswoman Susan McCabe declined to comment on the firm's courseif the DOL fiduciary rule were to be repealed. People familiar with Merrill'scompliance decisions say it is moving ahead with compliance in the meantime.It's unlikely Merrill would follow Commonwealth's line of thinking, according toMr. Sarch."They'd have a tougher time putting the fiduciary genie back in the bottlebecause they've been so public about this being the right thing for theircustomers," he said.LARGER ADVISER FORCECommonwealth also has a fraction of the impact of Merrill given Merrill's muchlarger adviser force and reach, he said.Some speculated that Merrill's compliance decision would push advisers to seekbroker-dealers that are going to continue to allow commission accounts under theregulation.But moving toward advisory-only business is the direction Merrill Lynch washeaded as a firm anyway, said Robert Cirrotti, managing director of investmentand retirement solutions for Pershing.And there are a number of actions Merrill could take to lessen the effects ofthe switch to advisory accounts "without creating perceived inconsistencies"with the overarching spirit of the rule, he said."There are things they could do on the margin that are more accommodating toadvisers," such as a less aggressive push from commission to advisory accounts,Mr. Cirrotti said.David Levine, principal at Groom Law Group, agreed, saying concepts from theregulation would likely remain but would be tweaked."I do think people may choose certain pieces and concepts," Mr. Levine said,while stressing that this all presupposes the fiduciary rule is repealed, whichisn't a given. "I think it will be a hybrid between business and legalcompliance."Similarly, Jeffrey Lieberman, counsel in the executive compensation and benefitsgroup at Skadden Arps Slate Meagher & Flom, said companies potentially couldmake some "accommodations" for smaller accounts that don't trade very much."They might be able to find ways to continue somewhat what they've done beforewith small [commission] accounts, and say, 'Maybe we can give you a little moreinfo than we thought we could'" under the fiduciary rule, Mr. Lieberman said."In some ways we may have a more fragmented compliance world than we have now,"Mr. Levine said.Twitter: @giacurci
