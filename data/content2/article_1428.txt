Now the criticisms begin of how Hillary Clinton ran her race. But Hillary hasnothing to regret and nothing that she needed to change in how she conducted hercampaign. Because she clearly won the popular vote, by 2 million votes in thelatest count. And just as clearly, Trump lost.If it were not for the antiquated Electoral College, she would bepresident-elect, and the discussions now would be about how effective hercampaign was, and how voters repudiated Trump. As it is, the votes of 2 millionAmericans have been discounted. That is a travesty and verges on a tragedy. But even saying that, I don't support the move for the Electoral Collegemembers to "vote their consciences" and overturn the election outcome. If thatproved successful, the angry storm we have heard from Hillary supporters wouldseem like a gentle wind compared with the hurricane from Trump's outragedsupporters, and there is no possible way she could govern effectively in theaftermath. It would also be the precedent every electoral loser in a closecampaign from now on would seize upon to disrupt the outcome. What we need is a constitutional amendment to repeal the Electoral College sothat every presidential election is won by the person with the most votes, justas in every other election in this country. I urge the protesters and"conscience" people to turn their energies in that direction so that the clearwill of the people cannot be legally denied again. For now, in the words of John McCain after he (legitimately) lost to Obama,"elections have consequences," and I hope the nation is strong enough to survivethem. Sally Bell Boulder
