An election recount will take place soon in Wisconsin, after former Green Partypresidential candidate Jill Stein filed a petition Friday with the state'sElections Commission, the first of three states where she has promised tocontest the election result.The move from Stein, who raised millions since her Wednesday announcement thatshe would seek recounts of Donald Trump's apparent election victories inWisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan, came 90 minutes before Wisconsin's 5 p.m.Friday deadline to file a petition. Now it will keep some hope alive for manyHillary Clinton supporters for another few weeks while Wisconsin recountsballots before a Dec. 13 deadline.Trump scored victories in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, and seems on the path todeclare a victory in Michigan, as well, although the result of the election inthat state will not be certified officially until Monday. Had Clinton won thosethree states, previously seen as part of the Democrats' "firewall," she wouldhave secured enough votes in the electoral college to win the election.Stein announced her intention to file the petition after reports that a group ofdata experts and election lawyers were urging Clinton to demand a recount inthose three states, on suspicion that a cyberattack could have manipulated theresults of the election in those states. While the group had no specific proofof hacking, members noted anomalies suggesting that Clinton routinely performedmore poorly in Wisconsin counties that used voting machines, as opposed to thosethat relied on paper ballots.Trump secured a total of 1,404,000 votes in Wisconsin, according to thecommission; Clinton had 1,381,823. Stein secured 31,006 votes.In the end, Stein was not the only presidential candidate to demand a recount.Roque "Rocky" De La Fuente, the Reform Party nominee who got 1,514 Wisconsinvotes, also file a recount petition, according to the state's ElectionsCommission.To be on the safe side, the group of experts urged a recount - but it wasStein's campaign that ended up demanding one, soliciting at first $2.5 millionand later up to $7 million to fund the recounts. As of Friday evening, Stein'scampaign reported taking in over $5.25 million in recount-related donations -the most by a third-party candidate in history.karoun.demirjian@washpost.com
