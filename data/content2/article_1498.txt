Former Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein withdrew her statewiderecount effort in Pennsylvania on Saturday after a Commonwealth Court judgemandated that the 100 voters who brought the suit on the campaign's behalf posta $1 million bond to press on with the challenge.In court documents filed ending the petition shortly before 5 p.m., an attorneyfor the Stein campaign wrote: "Petitioners are regular citizens of ordinarymeans. They cannot afford to post the $1,000,000 bond required by the Court."The abrupt halt to the campaign's strategy comes less than one week after Steinasked a Pennsylvania court to approve a statewide recount, contending the Nov. 8election was "illegal" and the results inaccurate.Still, according to statement issued on Stein's Facebook page just beforemidnight Saturday, a lawyer for the Stein recount effort indicated the fight inPennsylvania is not over. Beyond a second recount effort in the state - acounty-by-county attempt - that is still alive, Stein's attorney said thecampaign will file a petition in federal court Monday, "demanding a statewiderecount on constitutional grounds."Stein will hold a news conference about the Pennsylvania recount Monday at 10a.m. outside Trump Tower in New York.In pursuing the recount in Commonwealth court, the campaign cited research fromcomputer scientists suggesting that possible irregularities with electronicvoting machines could have made the election vulnerable to hackers. Stein'scampaign has hoped a recount in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan couldoverturn the results in three key swing states that historically back Democratsfor president but elected Donald Trump.In Pennsylvania, the statewide recount request was filed last Monday by at least100 voters, as required by Pennsylvania law, and was backed by the Steincampaign. No residents were named.On Friday, Commonwealth Court President Judge Mary Hannah Leavitt ordered thatthe $1 million be paid by this Monday."The judge's outrageous demand that voters pay such an exorbitant figure is ashameful, unacceptable barrier to democratic participation," Stein said in astatement Saturday. "This is yet another sign that Pennsylvania's antiquatedelection law is stacked against voters."After the lawsuit was withdrawn Saturday afternoon, hope for at least a partialrecount in Pennsylvania remained, as Stein's county-by-county recount effortwill continue, said Lawrence Otter, an attorney for the Stein campaign who filedcourt documents Saturday.In a separate effort, the campaign had hoped voters in Pennsylvania precinctswould submit petitions to their local election boards asking for recounts. Theprocess required three voters in each precinct to make the petition. Locally,petitions were filed in Philadelphia, Bucks, Montgomery, and Delaware Counties,Otter said - efforts that have been met with mixed success.Last week, Philadelphia's commissioners agreed to recount ballots in 75 of thecity's more than 1,600 divisions, but rejected a forensic audit of how thevoting machines worked. Judges in Bucks and Delaware Counties are expected tohold hearings on the matter this week, Otter said.A request for recounts in 72 of Montgomery County's precincts was rejected by ajudge last week. A partial recount in Allegheny County, which includesPittsburgh, will take place Monday.Together, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin - all of which voted Democrat inthe last two presidential elections - carry enough electoral votes to flip theelection. But so far, the state's top election official, Pedro Cortes, has saidthere was "no evidence whatsoever" of voting irregularities.Trump beat Clinton by about 49,500 votes, a gap that narrowed this week by about20,000 votes after results were updated.Stein's recount efforts have faced fierce pushback from Trump's team, whichfiled complaints last week in the three states to halt the recount efforts. Thediscontinuance in Pennsylvania is "a recognition that their election contest wascompletely without merit," Lawrence Tabas, lead counsel for Trump in the state,said Saturday.To fund the recounts, Stein last month established an online fund-raising drive,which by Saturday night had reached nearly $7 million. In Wisconsin, Stein wasrequired to pay nearly $3.5 million for the recount, which began Thursday.In Michigan, a statewide recount is slated to proceed. The state's Board ofState Canvassers deadlocked 2-2 Friday on Trump's request to reject the recount,meaning a recount will occur unless the courts step in to stop it.A hearing for the recount had been scheduled in state court Monday.
