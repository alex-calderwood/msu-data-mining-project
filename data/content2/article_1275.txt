Regarding the Nov. 21 news article "Final, faint hope to force vote on Garlanddashed":It is manifestly clear that Senate Republicans' refusal to take up PresidentObama's nomination of Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court has furtherinflamed partisan passions in our beloved country. The big question is howDemocrats should respond when Republicans hold the Senate and the White Houseand can presumably appoint anyone they like to fill the vacant seat.In this case, it is instructive to remember first lady Michelle Obama's words:"When they go low, we go high." Following this advice, Democrats could take aprincipled position on Supreme Court nominations under a President Donald Trump.They should offer that either hearings are held and an up-or-down vote taken onthe Garland nomination in the lame-duck session or Democrats will filibuster allfuture nominees to the court until after the next presidential election. SeveralRepublican senators were threatening to filibuster a President Hillary Clinton'sappointments, so Democrats could use their own words against them to justifytheir action.Hearings and a vote on Mr. Garland would offer our country an opportunity to seethat democratic traditions and conventions honed over 200 years of hard-foughtbattles will not be left in the dustbin of history and that our public officialsare, despite all evidence to the contrary, capable of living up to our bestexpectations of them.Gary Rucinski , Newton, Mass.
