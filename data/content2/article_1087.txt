The state,encouraged by Gov. Brown, crafted some of the nation's toughest air-qualitystandards while private companies took advantage of incentives to build mammothsolar plants in the desert? Will a different White House agenda that promises toembrace more traditional fossil fuels set a new tone? Danelski-Bender 30" Filephotos, graphic of desert power plants (stunning PE art of desert power plants)ETA: Thursday 6 pmFULL TEXTWind and solar power proponents hope to appeal to Republican President-electDonald Trump's desire for economic growth to persuade him to support theirindustries.Their business means jobs, they say, and the president-elect promised lots ofnew jobs."We are looking at continued growth and investment," said Greg Wetstone,president and CEO of the American Council on Renewable Energy.The green-power business is riding on an unprecedented wave, powered largely byPresident Barack Obama, who promoted alternative energy development as a way tocounter global warming. And he matched his enthusiasm with lucrative financialincentives.At the crest of that wave, alt-energy leaders hope to counter some of what Trumpsaid about windand solar energy during his presidential campaign and define their business as aproven brand of economic development.On the campaign trail, Trump called global warming a hoax invented by theChinese, despite much scientific consensus that supports the threat.In a radio interview with conservative activist Herman Cain last month, Trumpsaid: "Solar is very, very expensive. Wind is very, very expensive, and it onlyworks when it's windy." He also said that Riverside County's San Gorgonio Passarea "looks like a junkyard" because of aging wind farms. "It's the worst thingyou've ever seen."Trump also vowed to slash environmental regulations to bolster the oil, gas andcoal industries.But Trump has yet to speak about energy since the election and has appearedresponsive to advice from Obama and others.Once in the White House, he'll face growing international consensus on climatechange. At the ongoing United Nations climate talks in Marrakech, conferencechair Salaheddine Mezouar of Morocco offered: "Our message to the new Americanpresident is simply to say, 'We count on your pragmatism and your spirit ofcommitment.' "Trump's own stance isn't yet clear. In the same interview with Cain, thepresident-elect left the door open to more wind and solar development by adding:"I'm not saying I'm against those things. I'm for everything. I'm foreverything."Alternative energy experts, along with local and state officials, said theydon't expect to see a slowdown of residential or commercial solar energydevelopment in California.Tim Clark, Trump's California campaign state director, referred questions aboutTrump's energy policy to the president-elect's transition team. The team's webpage asks that press inquiries be sent by email. No one on the team responded toan inquiry for this report.Jack Pitney, a professor of politics at Claremont McKenna College, said cleanenergy probably will do fine if Trump can be convinced of its economicviability."He is a climate skeptic, so I wouldn't emphasize climate change," Pitney said."If I am a lobbyist for the solar industry, I would say this is an effectiveform of energy and people can make a lot of money selling it, and he'd be OKwith it."Two days after the election, about 70 energy, state and local officials gatheredin the desert near Blythe to celebrate the opening of two neighboring solarplants. The McCoy and Blythe facilities blanket more than 6 square miles offederal land in eastern Riverside County and create enough electricity for about181,000 households.The new projects exemplify a maturing industry still on the upswing.Like several other large-scale solar projects, they were built on federal landwith federal tax credits that covered 30 percent of the $1.2 billion developmentcost.In a deal approved by Congress last year that also helped the oil industry,those credits for solar will stay at 30 percent through 2019. They'll be phaseddown to 10 percent by 2022.Scott Busa, executive director of development for NextEra Energy, said thesecredits, plus already obtained land-use entitlements from the federal Bureau ofLand Management, will allow for the Blythe and McCoy projects to expand in thecoming years and more than double energy output."We are only about halfway there, and we look forward to future expansion," hesaid.Karen Douglas, a member of the California Energy Commission, also was at theNov. 10 ceremony in the desert. She said policies may shift in Washington, butCalifornia's commitment to clean energy that began in the 1970s is unwavering."This is going to continue," said Douglas, standing by a sea of solar panelsextending deep into the desert landscape.California, she said, must meet its own clean energy mandates, which requirethat 50 percent of the state's electricity come from carbon-free sources, suchas solar, wind and geothermal facilities.Industry officials are confident that Trump will see the economic benefits thatthey say make clean energy competitive with coal, oil, and natural gas.Wetstone said that demand for solar and other forms of alternative energy isincreasing as the costs are coming down.The organization estimates that the renewable energy industry attracts about $44billion a year in investments, creating thousand of jobs.Dan Whitten, a spokesman for the Solar Energy Industries Association, saidproponents should appeal to Trump's call for jobs and energy security. Doingthat could help the solar industry thrive during his administration."We don't see where he has a motive to stop this train from rolling forward,"Whitten said.Riverside County Supervisor John Benoit said he hopes eastern Riverside Countywill continue to benefit from solar development. His district includes thenation's largest solar development zone on public land.The zone runs along the I-10 corridor between Desert Center and Blythe.The Associated Press contributed to this report.
