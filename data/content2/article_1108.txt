HIGHLIGHT: The defiant president-elect told on-air stars like Lester Holt,Charlie Rose, George Stephanopoulos and Wolf Blitzer they got it all wrong.It had all the trappings of a high-level rapprochement: President-elect DonaldJ. Trump, now the nation's press critic in chief, inviting the leading anchorsand executives of television news to join him on Monday for a private meeting ofminds.On-air stars like Lester Holt, Charlie Rose, George Stephanopoulos and WolfBlitzer headed to Trump Tower for the off-the-record gathering, typically thekind of event where journalists and politicians clear the air after ahard-fought campaign.Instead, the president-elect delivered a defiant message: You got it all wrong.Mr. Trump, whose antagonism toward the news media was unusual even for a modernpresidential candidate, described the television networks as dishonest in theirreporting and shortsighted in missing the signs of his upset victory. Hecriticized some in the room by name, including CNN's president, Jeffrey A.Zucker, according to multiple people briefed on the meeting who were grantedanonymity to describe confidential discussions.It is not unusual for journalists to agree to off-the-record sessions withprominent politicians, including President Obama, as a way to gain insights anddevelop relationships.But after details of Mr. Trump's hectoring leaked on Monday in The New YorkPost, it seemed the meeting was being used as a political prop, especially afterTrump-friendly news outlets trumpeted the session as a take-no-prisoners move bya brave president-elect."Trump Slams Media Elite, Face to Face," blared the Drudge Report. "Trump EatsPress," wrote Breitbart News.Those curious to hear more of what the president-elect had to say at theclosed-door session were out of luck: Although more than two dozen prominentjournalists attended, many declined to comment because they had agreed to keepthe proceedings off the record.Kellyanne Conway, a top adviser to Mr. Trump, described the meeting in moretempered terms. "It was very cordial, very productive, very congenial," Ms.Conway told reporters at Trump Tower. "It was also very candid and very honest.""From my own perspective," she added, "it's great to hit the reset button."Still, the encounter crystallized concerns that Mr. Trump, emboldened by hisvictory, may refuse to abide the traditional dynamic of a president and thejournalists who cover him, a naturally adversarial relationship that isnevertheless based on some level of mutual trust.Some media critics questioned why the television networks, which granted Mr.Trump hundreds of hours of free exposure during the campaign, would agree toMonday's terms. "They learned *nothing* over past 18 months of covering Trump,"tweeted Erik Wemple of The Washington Post.Television is of particular interest to Mr. Trump, who is a keen watcher ofmorning shows and this past weekend tweeted his displeasure at being mocked onan episode of "Saturday Night Live."Coverage of Mr. Trump increased ratings and revenue at news networks, even assome executives conceded that, early in the race, the president-elect wasgranted too much free exposure. By the end of the campaign, Mr. Trump seemed toturn on certain networks and television journalists, in particular CNN,prompting supporters to chant anti-media slogans.Two people briefed on Monday's meeting said that Mr. Trump seemed well versed inthe networks' ratings increase during the election and did not hesitate to bringthe subject up.Mr. Trump is meeting with representatives of several news organizations thisweek, including The New York Times, where he is scheduled to speak on Tuesdaywith editors, reporters, columnists and the newspaper's publisher.Reince Priebus, Mr. Trump's chief of staff; Ivanka Trump, Mr. Trump's daughter;and Ms. Conway are expected to accompany the president-elect to The Times,according to a person with direct knowledge of the meeting.The meeting was organized at the request of Mr. Trump's team, Eileen Murphy, aspokeswoman for The Times, said on Monday. Mr. Trump is expected to speak on therecord with Times reporters and columnists; there is also a short off-the-recordsession planned, which Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman for Mr. Trump, described as "anopportunity to discuss past and future coverage."As a candidate, and now as president-elect, Mr. Trump has frequently attackedThe Times, establishing the paper as a top target in his continuing feud withthe media. Mr. Trump often refers to the"failing" New York Times and hasthreatened to sue the company for libel over an article about two women whoaccused him of touching them inappropriately years earlier.The failing @nytimes story is so totally wrong on transition. It is going sosmoothly. Also, I have spoken to many foreign leaders. - Donald J. Trump(@realDonaldTrump) November 16, 2016The Times angered Mr. Trump with some of its unflattering coverage during thecampaign, including reports on his taxes, his treatment of womenand his legaltroubles with Trump University.Since being elected president, he has blasted out more criticisms, using Twitterto disparage the newspaper's coverage and to claim it had lost "thousands ofsubscribers because of their very poor and highly inaccurate coverage of the'Trump phenomena.'" (The Times disputed that assertion, saying that it had added41,000 net paid subscriptions for its news products in the week after theelection.)John Koblin contributed reporting.PHOTO: Martha Raddatz of ABC at Trump Tower on Monday for a meeting of TVjournalists and executives called by Donald J.
