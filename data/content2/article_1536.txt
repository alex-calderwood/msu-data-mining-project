The importance of primariesReceived Nov. 29This election cycle has starkly revealed shortcomings in how presidentialcandidates are chosen.1. A small percentage of people (I believe less than 20 percent) who are activeparty members make this choice.2. Individual states determine their own procedure making any standardizationdifficult. Anyone moving to a new state has little guidance in learning astate's primary procedure.3. Capable people who have good ideas but are not active members of theRepublican or Democratic parties are often blocked from public expression anddebate.I would like to see some thoughtful ideas on ways this process might beimproved. Often individual states initiate new ways of doing things. Otherstates see what works and will follow. It shouldn't be too difficult to improveon Idaho's process if party activists are willing to share the power in thismost important selection process.Because our country is so huge, it is nearly impossible for the average personto get a true handle on the character, beliefs and outside influences of anyoneseeking political office. It is more doable within a state. If people within astate perform due diligence in selecting candidates in the primary, we mighthave a better starting lineup.It would help to have more robust Civics studies in our schools which mightencourage some promising individuals to think about high political offices asattainable and worth seeking. I look forward to some great ideas on improvingthe primary process to come forth!(Word count: 245)JILL ECKLESDAFERIdaho Falls
