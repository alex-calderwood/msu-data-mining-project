Mike Pence was elected vice president by a coalition of mostly white votersnostalgic for what they thought of as the good old days in America andgalvanized by promises to deport millions of undocumented immigrants.On Friday night, Pence came face-to-face with a symbol of the new America: A hitmusical called "Hamilton" that celebrates the principles of the nation'sfounding but reimagines the revolutionary period with multiracial actors playingthe statesmen and the contributions of immigrants central to the story.As he took his seat in New York's Richard Rogers Theater, Pence heard asmattering of boos. He sat through a performance celebrating the country'smulticulturalism. And when the show was over and he headed for the exits, thecast was not quite finished."We, sir, we are the diverse America who are alarmed and anxious that your newadministration will not protect us, our planet, our children, our parents, ordefend us and uphold our inalienable rights, sir," said Brandon Victor Dixon,the actor who played Aaron Burr, reading a statement the cast members haddrafted together."But we truly hope this show has inspired you to uphold our American values andwork on behalf of all of us. All of us," he continued.The remarkable moment crystallized the cleavage wrought by a toxic presidentialcampaign, in which millions of aggrieved white Americans propelled Donald Trumpand Pence to the White House and left millions of others -- blacks and Latinos,gays and lesbians, Muslims and Jews -- fearful of what might become of theircountry."It was this collision of two different Americas and two different visions andtwo different sets of experiences, happening at once, and happening in a ratherdramatic way," said Peter Wehner, a former speechwriter to President George W.Bush and a fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center.By Saturday morning, Trump decided to respond. He could have chosen to offerassurances that he would be a president for all Americans -- that he wouldrespect everybody regardless of race or gender or creed.But Trump being Trump, the president-elect punched back."The Theater must always be a safe and special place," Trump tweeted. "The castof Hamilton was very rude last night to a very good man, Mike Pence. Apologize!"There was a certain irony to Trump's demand, considering that as a candidate herarely if ever apologized for the blizzard of insults he sprayed across thecountry."Have you ever apologized? Ever? In your lifetime? Close your eyes, think backto Baby Donald ...," Jimmy Fallon asked Trump on NBC's "Tonight Show" inSeptember 2015."I fully think apologizing is a great thing, but you have to be wrong," Trumpreplied.He added, with a laugh, "I will absolutely apologize sometime in the hopefullydistant future, if I'm ever wrong."LOAD-DATE: November 21, 2016LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: Newspaper
