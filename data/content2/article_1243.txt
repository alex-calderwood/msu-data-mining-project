WASHINGTON - Jill Stein is on track to raise twice as much for an electionrecount effort than she did for her own failed Green Party presidential bid.Fueled by the social media hashtag #recount2016 and millions of dispiritedHillary Clinton voters, Stein's recount drive had already netted $6.3 million byMonday, according to her campaign website. That's close to the $7 million sheposted as a goal and millions more than the roughly $3.5 million she raisedduring her entire presidential bid.Citing without evidence concerns about "cyber hacking," Stein wants a recount inWisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania - places that Clinton, a Democrat, thoughtwere safely in her column. Instead, Republican Donald Trump won all three andwith them the electoral votes needed to win the White House.Stein won no states and wouldn't directly or immediately benefit from a recount- nor would she likely be able to topple Trump. Even Clinton's attorney MarcElias wrote there's "no actionable evidence of hacking or outside attempts toalter the voting technology."But Stein's effort could help her in other ways.By continuing to raise money, she is building up a larger donor list that shecan later turn to if she runs again. She also can try to influence policy byurging those donors to call lawmakers or contribute to other politicians. Hercampaign says 137,000 people have contributed to the recount.A bigger supporter list can command bigger fees if Stein chooses to lease it outto other campaigns.Laurence Tribe, a Harvard constitutional law professor, said that althoughrecounts are "entirely within the law," Stein's effort is probably aimed more at"trying to gain attention and establish herself as a national player."Stein said she is "proud to stand up for election integrity" regardless ofwhether it changes the outcome of the presidential race. If she raises moremoney than is needed for the recount itself - including multimillion-dollarattorney fees - her campaign will use the surplus for "election integrityefforts and to promote voting system reform."Stein has reminded supporters that they can contribute up to $2,700 for herrecount drive - even if they'd already donated the maximum $2,700 to her for thegeneral election. Any money she raises in excess of the actual recount costscould then be donated to charity or to a political party, according to FederalElection Commission rulings."The money can't be used for her personal benefit, but beyond that there's someflexibility," said Bob Biersack, who worked at the FEC for three decades.The recount itself could be costly.The Wisconsin Elections Commission voted Monday to proceed with a recount andwill bill Stein and other interested campaigns for the costs, estimated to bearound $1 million. The cost would rise if a court grants her request for a handrecount.Stein's campaign filed a lawsuit in Pennsylvania on Monday seeking a statewiderecount, but it wasn't clear if the courts had the authority to order one. Thecampaign also says that on Wednesday it will request a Michigan recount.Trump denounced the Stein recount effort as "ridiculous" and "a scam."It's a way for Stein "to fill her coffers with money, most of which she willnever even spend on this ridiculous recount," the president-elect said Saturday.
