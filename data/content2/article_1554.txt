LANSING, Mich. - Green Party presidential nominee Jill Stein on Wednesdayrequested a full hand recount of Michigan's presidential vote, making it thethird state narrowly won by Republican Donald Trump where she wants another lookat the results.Stein previously asked for recounts of the votes in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.President-elect Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton by about 10,700 votesout of nearly 4.8 million ballots cast in Michigan, or two-tenths of apercentage point. But Stein alleges that irregularities and the possibility thatvote scanning devices could have been hacked call the results into question.Elections officials in all three states have expressed confidence in theresults.Michigan's recount could start as early as Friday, though a challenge to therecount by Trump may delay it.University of Michigan computer scientist Alex Halderman, who says votingmachines and optical scanners that count ballots are prone to errors and outsidemanipulation, told reporters that the recount will show "for sure" whethercyber-attacks have occurred.Trump's victory is highly unlikely to be reversed in any of the states.The GOP says a Michigan recount would cost taxpayers far more than the $973,000Stein paid when filing her recount petition.Secretary of State Ruth Johnson, a Republican, called Stein's request "unusual,"especially since there is no evidence of fraud or "even a credible allegation ofany tampering."Nevertheless, county clerks have been gearing up to complete this recount undera very challenging (Dec. 13) deadline," she said. "They'll be working nights andweekends. I know they will do a great job because we have some of the bestclerks in the country here in Michigan."Meanwhile in Wisconsin, where Trump defeated Clinton by roughly 22,000 votes,Stein's campaign said it won't appeal a judge's ruling that Wisconsin's recountcan be done without counting every ballot by hand. Most counties plan to do handrecounts anyway. That recount is due to start Thursday.The Wisconsin Republican Party filed a complaint with the Federal ElectionsCommission on Wednesday alleging that Stein's recount effort amounts to illegalcoordination with Clinton designed to circumvent the law and public scrutiny.Stein's campaign manager, David Cobb, said in a statement that Stein isn'tcoordinating with anyone and he dismissed the complaint as a "PR stunt to push afalse narrative that will ultimately have no impact on the recount inWisconsin."
