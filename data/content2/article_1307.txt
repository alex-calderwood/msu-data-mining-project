Some balk at key  job going to criticPresident-elect looks at other candidates for StatePresident-elect Donald Trump is for now unswayed by the extraordinarily publicrevolt by some of his top advisers and allies over the possible choice of MittRomney as secretary of state and continues to see his foe as a serious contenderfor the diplomatic post, several people briefed on the deliberations saidMonday.Romney plans to have a private dinner Tuesday with Trump, who is said to beintrigued by the notion of reconciling with one of his fiercest Republicanantagonists - even as he also weighs rewarding the loyalty of former New Yorkmayor Rudolph W. Giuliani with one of the administration's most prized jobs orselecting a decorated military officer in David H. Petraeus.Trump is looking for assurances that Romney, the 2012 Republican presidentialnominee who has championed a muscular and at times interventionist foreignpolicy, could be trusted to defend and promote Trump's markedly differentworldview in capitals around the globe, the people familiar with thepresident-elect's deliberations said.Giuliani has openly campaigned for the job and has told friends that he islikely to get it. But Trump's team has determined that it may be challenging andeven unlikely for Giuliani to win Senate confirmation: His web of internationalbusiness interests and the millions of dollars he has earned in paid speechesand consulting work for foreign entities would come under scrutiny, while Sen.Rand Paul (Ky.), one of 10 Republicans on the Foreign Relations Committee, hasthreatened to block Giuliani's nomination.Romney and Giuliani have been seen as co-favorites to lead the State Department,but Trump this week is expanding his search to include other candidates, chiefamong them Petraeus, a retired Army general and former CIA director.Transition officials said Trump has long admired Petraeus and described hiscandidacy as formidable, despite the baggage he would carry into anyconfirmation battle because of his 2015 conviction for mishandling classifiedinformation. Petraeus's public service career came to an end amid revelationsthat he had an affair with his biographer, Paula Broadwell, and sharedclassified information with her.On the campaign trail, Trump played down the significance of Petraeus'sconviction, repeatedly arguing that it was "a fraction" of what Democraticnominee Hillary Clinton had gotten away with by using a personal email server assecretary of state.Petraeus and Trump met Monday afternoon in New York for about an hour, with VicePresident-elect Mike Pence joining them for part of the session. As the generalexited Trump Tower following their session, he praised Trump, telling reportersthat he "showed a great grasp of a variety of the challenges that are out thereand some of the opportunities as well. Very good conversation, and we'll seewhere it goes from here."Trump later tweeted, "Just met with General Petraeus - was very impressed!"Trump will meet Tuesday with Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), who officials said couldemerge as a candidate, although the senator has said that he is unlikely to endup in serious contention. As chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee,Corker would oversee the confirmation process of Trump's nominee.Trump is hiring for other key positions as well. He has chosen Rep. Tom Price(R-Ga.), one of the Hill's fiercest critics of President Obama's health-carelaw, to be secretary of health and human services. And Trump met Monday with twocandidates for secretary of homeland security: Frances Townsend, a formerhomeland security official in the George W. Bush administration, and DavidClarke, the controversial sheriff of Milwaukee County, Wis. Trump is to meetTuesday with a third contender, Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Tex.), who chairs theHouse Homeland Security Committee.The nascent Trump transition has been riven by infighting over the possiblenomination of Romney, who is seen as the quintessential establishment figure andwho spoke out against Trump's candidacy in unusually harsh and personal terms.Pence and some Trump advisers are said to have argued that Romney would be asteady hand prepared to help shape relationships around the world. Trump is saidto have buried the hatchet with Romney at their Nov. 19 meeting in Bedminster,N.J., and sees a political benefit to bringing him into the administration:silencing a rival Republican who has a big microphone and a network of wealthydonors.But other Trump intimates have advocated forcefully for Giuliani, a trustedloyalist and brash Trump defender who developed a close bond with the candidateand is more ideologically in sync with him.The feud spilled into the open over Thanksgiving weekend as Kellyanne Conway,Trump's former campaign manager and now a senior adviser to the transition team,attacked Romney's credentials and trustworthiness in a trio of Sunday televisionappearances. Conway said on CNN that she has received a "breathtaking" amount ofmessages from Trump supporters "who feel betrayed to think that Governor Romneywould get the most prominent Cabinet post after he went so far out of his way tohurt Donald Trump."Conway is part of a cadre of Trump allies who are waging an unprecedented publicbattle against Romney in an attempt to influence the president-elect's decision,sow doubts about Romney in the minds of Trump's core supporters and create anenvironment in which he would be a toxic nominee.Rep. Chris Collins (R-N.Y.), one of Trump's top backers on Capitol Hill, blastedRomney on Monday on CNN as "a self-serving egomaniac who puts himself first, whohas a chip on his shoulder and thinks that he should be president of the UnitedStates."And Brent Bozell, an influential conservative activist, issued a statementdeclaring that "the very idea of Mitt Romney as Secretary of State - or anyother cabinet position in a Trump administration - is a slap to hissupporters.''Trump observers said the president-elect has taken a page out of his playbookfor "The Apprentice," his hit reality show on NBC."Trump is pitting people against other people, seeing how it plays out," saidJeffrey Tulis, a professor of government at the University of Texas at Austin.He said Romney is being "humiliated by the process" but that Trump "has a modelof conflict between advisers and subordinates that he thinks has worked for himin his business and on his TV show. He's very comfortable with turmoil."Over the Thanksgiving break, as Trump relaxed with his wife, Melania, and familyat his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Fla., he asked guests and friends toweigh in on the choice between Romney and Giuliani. Two Trump friends confirmedthe holiday discussions, which were first reported by the New York Post."Donald personally wasn't negative on Romney, but said he had gotten a lot ofnegative feedback on Romney, and Melania also had gotten a lot of negativefeedback. And it seemed clear he had reservations about Rudy," said one personclose to the transition, who requested anonymity to recount privateconversations with the Trumps.Joe Scarborough, the host of MSNBC's "Morning Joe," reported on air Monday thatConway had committed "an act of sabotage" against Romney and that Trump was"furious" with her.Later Monday morning, on a conference call with reporters, Trump spokesman JasonMiller would neither confirm nor deny that characterization of Trump's attitude.He said only, "I'll leave that to the president-elect if he wants to add anyadditional commentary."Miller added that Trump was meeting with Romney on Tuesday because "the two,quite frankly, haven't spent much time together, so this gives them a littlemore time to do so.''Conway did not respond to a request for comment and declined to speak withreporters at Trump Tower. At 7:37 p.m., she tweeted a photo of her and Trump inhis office studying something on a computer screen, saying they were "workinghard" together.One associate said that although Trump "likes the theatrics of it all," he haschafed at feeling pressured to nominate Giuliani.Other Trump associates, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity because ofthe sensitivity of the matter, poured cold water on the suggestion that Conwaywas freelancing."The boss is genuinely conflicted," one transition official said. A thirdperson, who is close to the transition team, added, "I don't think Kellyannewent off the reservation. [Still,] Trump would love to have Romney work for him... and at the very least, he loves to have Romney grovel for the job."Jim Manley, a longtime senior Senate aide who most recently worked for SenateMinority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.), said the public approach Trump is takingis both "undiplomatic" and "gauche.""One of the most important positions in our government is being used as apolitical football to settle political scores," Manley said. "Of all my years ofwatching the confirmation process, I've never seen anything like this. ...You've got staff who may or may not be going rogue to advance their own agenda."It's bringing out the worst in people."One of Trump's biggest concerns is whether Romney would advocate Trump'sperspective in closed-door meetings with foreign leaders. The two men havedifferent views on Russia's aggression and U.S. trade policy, among otherissues, although they have similarly aggressive postures when it comes tofighting Islamic State terrorists and cracking down on a Chinese government theysee as manipulative and exploitative.Doug Wilson, chairman of the board of advisers of the Truman National SecurityProject, said Trump should be certain there is "a cohesive foreign policy thatwill be supported by all the players.""It's one thing to talk about a team of rivals," Wilson said, a reference toformer president Abraham Lincoln's Cabinet. "It's another thing to talk about ateam of rivals when you go beyond the water's edge."philip.rucker@washpost.comjohn.wagner@washpost.comDavid Nakamura in New York and Jerry Markon and Elise Viebeck in Washingtoncontributed to this report.
