Although Chris Cillizza was correct in his Nov. 28 Monday Fix column, "Earlyleads in 2020 race, but no clear Democratic heir " [news], in which he listedpossible Democratic presidential contenders for 2020, he was not looking outsidethe box of the Beltway - other than citing one relatively unknown governor.If the 2016 election has taught us anything, it is that America has become acult of celebrity. Democrats have to understand this. If President-elect DonaldTrump runs for reelection in 2020, the Democrats had better be willing to fightfire with fire.I suggest Mark Cuban, a billionaire from TV's "Shark Tank," who was an outspokencritic of Mr.Trump in this election. Mr. Cuban has money and similar celebritystatus but none of the temperamental or sexual baggage that could be used againagainst Mr. Trump in 2020. Throw in as a running mate Sen. Elizabeth Warren(D-Mass.) or one of the other female senators Mr. Cillizza mentioned, and youwould have the dream ticket to ensure Mr. Trump is a one-term president.Don Gidley , Harpers Ferry, W.Va.
