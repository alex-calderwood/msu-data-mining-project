PALM BEACH, Fla. - Injecting the first diversity into his Cabinet-to-be, DonaldTrump selected two Republican women on Wednesday who disparaged him during thepresidential campaign: South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley to serve as U.S.ambassador to the United Nations and charter school advocate Betsy DeVos to leadthe federal Department of Education.Gov. Haley has little foreign policy experience, yet Trump praised her as "aproven dealmaker." DeVos, like Trump, is new to government but has spent decadesworking to change America's system of public education.DeVos and Haley are the first women selected for top-level administration postsas the president-elect works to shape a White House team from scratch. Haley isthe daughter of Indian immigrants, so she also would be his first minorityselection after a string of announcements of white men.Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson said "an announcement is forthcoming" on hisrole, which would make him the first black choice - presumably as secretary ofHousing and Urban Development - but he also suggested he'd be thinking about itover the Thanksgiving holiday.Wednesday's picks came as Trump worked to distance himself from the "alt-right,"a movement of white supremacists who continue to cheer his election.He announced his two new choices in a statement released as he gathered withfamily behind closed doors at his Palm Beach estate for Thanksgiving.Bad blood between Trump and his new Cabinet selections was evident through muchof this year's campaign.DeVos told The Associated Press in July, "A lot of the things he has said arevery off-putting and concerning."On Wednesday, Trump said of his UN selection: "Gov. Haley has a proven trackrecord of bringing people together regardless of background or party affiliationto move critical policies forward for the betterment of her state and ourcountry."She said she loved her South Carolina post but "when the president believes youhave a major contribution to make to the welfare of our nation, and to ournation's standing in the world, that is a calling that is important to heed."While Republicans praised Haley's selection, DeVos faced criticism from left andright.At the same time, some conservatives warned that the longtime Republican donor,who has spent millions of dollars - along with her husband - to promotecandidates who favor charter schools and school vouchers, also supports theCommon Core education standards that Trump railed against during the campaign.Conservatives already were grappling with Trump's Tuesday concession thatclimate change may be connected to human activity and his reversal of a campaignvow to pursue a criminal investigation into Democratic rival Hillary Clinton.DeVos addressed criticism head-on, posting a "Q&A" statement that said directlyabout Common Core: "I am not a supporter - period."Spokesman Jason Miller said Trump now is focusing on his choice for secretary ofstate in particular. Among those under consideration: former New York Mayor andTrump loyalist Rudy Giuliani and 2012 GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney,formerly an outspoken Trump critic.After secretary of state, the UN ambassador is the highest-profile diplomaticposition, often serving as the voice for U.S. positions on the internationalstage.
