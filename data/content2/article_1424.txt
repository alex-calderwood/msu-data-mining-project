College lessonsThere have been four presidential elections in which the winner received fewervotes than the loser: John Quincy Adams (1824), Benjamin Harrison (1888), GeorgeW. Bush (2000) and Donald J. Trump (2016). The system is unfair andanachronistic and needs to be replaced.It is unfair because the votes of citizens of small states are worth more thanthe votes of citizens in the larger states. For example, Wyoming has apopulation of about 600,000 and it has three electoral votes -- 200,000 peopleper electoral vote. California has a population of about 38 million and has 55electoral votes -- about 700,000 people per electoral vote. The weight of aWyoming voter, therefore, is three times more than that of a California voter.There are 10 states with a population of one million or less in the samecategory of excessive electoral influence. The Electoral College was createdwhen the USA consisted of 13 colonies of about equal population and peopleneeded to own property in order to vote.The Electoral College has outlived its usefulness and ought to be replaced witha straight popular vote in which each vote has the same weight.Andy LogothetisWilmingtonPurpose of ECI think it s time that someone remind those Republicans who are doing cartwheelsin the Buzz and Letters to the Editor that their razor-thin margin of victorywas only possible because of the Electoral College, not because the majority ofthe people voted for Donald Trump.The College, a vestigial provision of the Constitution, was created by thefounders because they felt that the job of electing a president was tooimportant to be left to the House of Representatives or the people, not to keepthe rich and powerful states from running roughshod over the smaller states.A quote from my World Book encyclopedia states that  The Fathers of theConstitution hoped this procedure would promote calm deliberations and selectionof the best-qualified man.In any event, it is what it is, and there is minimal chance of changing it. Imention it only to remind the Republicans that they believe in a strictinterpretation of the Constitution.The Democrats will have to live with it and wait and see what will happen fouryears from now when the factory jobs in Wisconsin and Michigan do not come backand when the miners in Pennsylvania realize that coal is not the wave of thefuture and they are not able to buy their medical insurance thru the AffordableCare Act and when those terrified of the people mowing their lawns find out thatthe new definition of Big Beautiful Wall really means small fence and they aregoing to pay for it.Then maybe they will start to wonder why they voted for a man for president thatmost of them wouldn t invite to dinner in their home.John SabellaSupplyDon t ignore AppI think it s time your sports department started providing a bit more coverageof Appalachian State football. A recent article in your paper from theFayetteville Observer compared the Football Bowl Subdivision teams in NorthCarolina and ASU came out head of the class.But you could never tell it by the coverage during the season from your paper.UNC, NC State, Duke, and of course ECU always get the coverage, with Appalachians games normally relegated to the list of national scores. Rarely is there everan actual story printed about the Mountaineers. ...I think it s time a little more respect should be shown to one of the mostconsistent football programs in this state.Michael ThompsonBurgaw
