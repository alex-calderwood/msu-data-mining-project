UW-Madison's Clifton Conrad cautions that Betsy DeVos' track record of advocacyfor charter schools for elementary and high school students may indicate thatPresident-elect Donald Trump's nominee for secretary of education will push toprivatize public higher education too."I have an underlying fear that her uncompromising commitment to deregulatingcharter schools in Michigan signals that she will advance the privatization ofhigher education? with increased funding for for-profit institutions, sabotagingour public colleges and universities and in, in turn, their longstandingcontributions to the public good," Conrad said Monday in an email message.Conrad is a professor in the School of Education and faculty director of theWisconsin Center for the Advancement of Postsecondary Education at UW-Madison.DeVos, who led the Michigan Republican Party from 1996-2000, is a leader in thenational school-choice movement. She has supported political candidates whofavor charter schools and voucher programs for low-income K-12 students as chairof the American Federation for Children, the political arm of the Alliance forSchool Choice, a nonprofit advocacy organization.Trump supported a major expansion of school choice programs during thepresidential campaign.DeVos' lack of experience in higher education issues, however, is raising someconcern, as is the fact she has never worked for an educational institution.Conrad said flatly that DeVos "is not qualified for this position."DeVos' resume gaps are drawing concern from varied quarters. Neal McCluskey,director of the libertarian-leaning Cato Institute's Center for EducationalFreedom, said the Department of Education's role in higher education isgigantic, the Chronicle of Higher Education reported."DeVos will essentially be taking over a hugely bureaucratic lending company ?with lots of regulatory power ? that on a dayto- day basis could prove to be afar greater burden than she expected," McCluskey wrote in an analysis of hernomination.Donald E. Heller, provost at the University of San Francisco who was previouslydean of the College of Education at Michigan State University, told theChronicle that DeVos may loosen enforcement of regulations on for-profitcolleges. The Obama administration took a hard line on schools whose students godeep into debt but leave without credentials for a well-paying job.DeVos' past work with faith-based organizations could suggest that she wouldpush for federal funding for private and religious institutions at the expenseof public institutions," Heller said.But DeVos does bring some skill to the table, he acknowledged."One advantage she brings, to be fair, is that she's very involved in thepolitical process and policy," he said.
