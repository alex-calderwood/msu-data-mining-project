The president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland said Wednesday it's toosoon to speculate on how President-elect Donald Trump's economic agenda willshape the Fed's monetary policies going forward.In a speech in Pittsburgh, Loretta Mester also reaffirmed her view that the Fedshould raise interest rates when it meets again later this month."I view another increase in interest rates as a prudent step to take" tomaintain economic stability, Ms. Mester said in an address to theAfrican-American Chamber of Commerce of Western Pennsylvania at the Omni WilliamPenn Hotel, Downtown.At its last meeting, held the week before the Nov. 8 presidential election, theFed voted to keep interest rates unchanged but indicated a hike could come inDecember as long the economy continues to expand. At that meeting, Ms. Mesterwas one of two members of the Fed's Open Market Committee who dissented andsupported an immediate rate hike."I view a small step up in interest rates as appropriate - not because I want tocurtail the expansion, but because I believe it will help prolong theexpansion," she said Wednesday."If we delay too long and then find ourselves in a situation where the labormarket becomes unsustainably tight, price pressures become excessive and we haveto move rates steeply, we could risk a recession - a bad outcome thatdisproportionately harms the more vulnerable parts of our society."The Fed, the nation's central bank, oversees the country's financial system bysetting the federal funds rate - the interest rate at which banks loan money toeach other overnight.The current target range for the rate is 0.25 percent to 0.50 percent. Forecastspublished by the Fed in September indicate members expect the rate to rise to1.1 percent by the end of 2017.While she acknowledged fiscal policy changes are likely under the newadministration as it considers trade deals, taxes and infrastructure spending,"The timing and size of the impacts are very uncertain at this point," Ms.Mester said.The Fed plans to study the Trump administration's policies to determine how theywill affect employment, inflation and other factors, she said. But until theyare disclosed, "The devil will be in the details."As president of the Cleveland Fed, a post she's held since 2014, Ms. Mesteroversees 950 employees in a region that includes Cleveland, Pittsburgh andCincinnati.She praised Pittsburgh for diversifying its economic base into health care,education, financial services and technology following the collapse of heavymanufacturing in the 1970s and 1980s. She said the region's well-educatedworkforce helps attract new businesses and events such as the White HouseFrontiers Conference on innovation held here in October.As for campaign promises by the president-elect to bring back coal and steeljobs to the region, "I don't think you can change the underlying aspects of theeconomy," Ms. Mester said.In its most recent Beige Book report on economic conditions nationwide releasedWednesday, the Fed said the region that includes Pittsburgh showed stablemanufacturing output, an improved housing market, and gains for commercialbuilders.Retail sales, including new cars, declined, the report said.
