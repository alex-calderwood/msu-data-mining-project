It is the product of an 18th century compromiseforged over issues that no longer apply, on assumptions about the wisdom of theaverage person we no longer hold, and it has not worked the way it was intended.But abolishing it through a constitutional amendment is generally considered anon-starter - it would require either a two-thirds vote of both chambers ofCongress or a constitutional convention called by two-thirds of statelegislatures just to propose such an amendment, and then it would need to beapproved by three-fourths of the states. The chances that three-fourths of thestates would be upset about the Electoral College at any given time are slim;it's theoretically possible for a candidate to win the presidency with just 11big states, but it would require an extremely odd electoral coalition.There is another way, though. Ten states plus Washington, D.C., have enactedlegislation that could lead to a system that leaves the Electoral College intactbut ensures that it deliver the presidency to the popular vote winner. Thisnational compact stipulates that as soon as states comprising a majority of theElectoral College - 270 votes - sign on, each will award its electoral votes tothe winner of the national popular vote. The Constitution allows states toallocate their electors as they choose - the winner-take-all system is not inthe Constitution, and Maine and Nebraska have already abandoned it, choosing tosplit their electoral votes based on who wins in each congressional district.There are good reasons beyond sour grapes to advocate for a change. Leaders ofthe National Popular Vote movement point to the disproportionate attentionpresidential candidates pay to a handful of states during the election - andafter. According to NPV's research, battleground states get more federal grants,more federal disaster declarations and more waivers from certain federalregulations. But the biggest reason to ditch the Electoral College is that itviolates the principle that each American voter should have an equal say indeciding who is president. Here's why:Each state gets a number of Electoral College votes equal to its totalrepresentation in Congress - both its representatives and its senators. Butbecause each state gets two senators, no matter its size, voters in the smalleststates have disproportionate influence over the outcome. On average, each of the538 electoral votes should represent just under 600,000 people. But in someplaces, it takes less than half that to determine an electoral vote. It's notjust Republican-leaning states that are so advantaged; Vermont, Washington,D.C., and Rhode Island all make the list, and Delaware isn't far behind.Meanwhile, it takes substantially more people than it should to swing anelectoral vote in some other states - as much as 20 percent more than it should.Notwithstanding the fact that President-elect Donald Trump called the ElectoralCollege "a disaster for democracy" in a 2012 election night tweet (he evidentlythought at the time that Mitt Romney would win the popular vote and lose theElectoral College, though he wound up losing both), we don't expect Republicansto take up the cause until one of their nominees suffers the fate of Clinton andAl Gore. It's only a matter of time. Had John Kerry convinced 59,301 George W.Bush voters in Ohio to support him instead, he would have taken the presidencyin 2004 despite losing the popular vote by 3 million.This is no way to pick a president, and we can fix it. A petition on change.orgcalling for members of the Electoral College to vote for Clinton rather thanTrump got more than 2 million signatures in under 36 hours, but if people reallywant change, they should lobby their state legislators to support the ElectoralCollege compact.- The Baltimore Sun
