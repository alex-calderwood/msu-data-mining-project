HIGHLIGHT:Â Alternative energy proponents hope stressing jobs and economic growthwill bring the president-elect on board.Wind and solar power proponents hope to appeal to Republican President-electDonald Trump's desire for economic growth to persuade him to support theirindustries.They hope to counter some of what Trump said about wind and solar energy duringhis presidential campaign. President Barack Obama, a Democrat, promotedalternative energy development as a way to counter global warming.But Trump has called global warming a hoax invented by the Chinese - despitescientific consensus that the problem is real.In a radio interview with conservative activist Herman Cain last month, Trumpsaid: "Solar is very, very expensive. Wind is very, very expensive, and it onlyworks when it's windy."He also said Riverside County's San Gorgonio Pass area "looks like a junkyard"because of aging wind farms. "It's the worst thing you've ever seen," he said.Trump also vowed to slash environmental regulations to bolster the oil, gas andcoal industries.Yet alternative energy experts, along with local and state officials, said theydon't expect to see a slowdown of residential or commercial solar energydevelopment in California.The industry has too much momentum to be slowed by a cold shoulder from theWhite House, they said.Trump's rhetoric is cloudy. In the interview with Cain, the president-elect leftthe door open to more wind and solar development by adding: "I'm not saying I'magainst those things. I'm for everything. I'm for everything."Tim Clark, Trump's California campaign director, referred questions aboutTrump's energy policy to his transition team. The team's website asks that pressinquiries be sent by email. No one on the team responded to an inquiry for thisreport.Jack Pitney, a professor of politics at Claremont McKenna College, said cleanenergy probably will do fine if Trump can be convinced of its economicviability."He is a climate skeptic, so I wouldn't emphasize climate change," Pitney said."If I am a lobbyist for the solar industry, I would say this is an effectiveform of energy and people can make a lot of money selling it, and he'd be OKwith it."Two days after the election, about 70 energy, state and local officials gatheredin the desert near Blythe to celebrate the opening of two neighboring solarplants.The McCoy and Blythe facilities blanket more than 6 square miles of federal landin eastern Riverside County and create enough electricity for about 181,000households.The new projects exemplify a maturing industry still on the upswing.Like several other large-scale solar projects, they were built on federal landwith federal tax credits that covered 30 percent of the $1.2 billion developmentcost.In a deal approved by Congress last year that also helped the oil industry,those credits for solar will stay at 30 percent through 2019. They'll be phaseddown to 10 percent by 2022.Scott Busa, executive director of development for NextEra Energy, said thesecredits, plus already obtained land-use entitlements from the federal Bureau ofLand Management, will allow for the Blythe and McCoy projects to expand in thecoming years and more than double energy output."We are only about halfway there, and we look forward to future expansion," hesaid.Ka ren Douglas, a member of the California Energy Commission, also was at theNov. 10 ceremony in the desert. She said policies may shift in Washington, butCalifornia's commitment to clean energy that began in the 1970s is unwavering."This is going to continue," said Douglas, standing by a sea of solar panelsextending deep into the desert landscape.California, she said, must meet its own clean energy mandates, which requirethat half the state's electricity come from carbon-free sources, such as solar,wind and geothermal facilities.I ndustry officials are confident Trump will see the economic benefits that theysay make clean energy competitive with coal, oil and natural gas.Greg Wetstone, president and chief executive of the American Council onRenewable Energy, said demand for solar and other forms of alternative energy isincreasing as the costs are coming down.The organization estimates that the renewable energy industry attracts $44billion a year in investments, creating thousand of jobs."We are looking at continued growth and investment," Wetstone said.Dan Whitten, a spokesman for the Solar Energy Industries Association, saidproponents should appeal to Trump's call for jobs and energy security. Doingthat could help the solar industry thrive during his administration."We don't see where he has a motive to stop this train from rolling forward,"Whitten said.Riverside County Supervisor John Benoit said he hopes eastern Riverside Countywill continue to ben efit from solar development. His district includes thenation's largest solar development zone on public land.The zone runs along the I-10 corridor between Desert Center and Blythe.But Benoit remains concerned about Trump's knowledge of alternative energy,saying much of the president-elect's rhetoric is "in serious error."For instance, in the Cain interview, Trump said that "thousands of birds arelying on the ground" near Palm Springs wind farms. And he said that wind farmskill eagles "by the hundreds."Wind turbines do kill birds - but not on the scale described by Trump.A 2013 report by U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service officials documented 85 eagledeaths (six bald eagles and 79 golden eagles) at 32 wind farms in 10 states thatoccurred from 1997 to 2012.Th e number may be higher because coyotes and other scavengers may remove thecarcasses before they are found, wild life officials have sa id.Still, wind and solar development creates jobs and has "zero impact on airquality," said Benoit, a Republican. "I would hope that his rhetoric will betempered by business realities."951-368-9471 or ddanelski@scng.com
