Reporters monitoring the flow of visitors toTrump Tower on Thursday said only that the president-elect was scheduled to meetwith Catz, along with others includingcTexas Representative Jeb Hensarling,whose name has been floated for Treasury secretary; FedEx Corp. Chief ExecutiveOfficer Fred Smith; and Florida Governor Rick Scott.And itcs not clear how well, if at all, Catz and Trump know one another. TheWashington Post reported that Catz, who was named co-chief executive (along withMark Hurd) of Oracle in 2014 when company co-founder Ellison stepped back fromthe CEO role, has donated to bothcDemocratic and Republican candidates in thepast. This year, Catz, Hurd, and Ellison all gave money to the campaign ofSenator Marco Rubio, who ran against Trump in the Republican presidentialprimaries.If she were being considered for a post in the Trump White House, Catz comeswith stellar credentials, boasting extensive experience in finance. AtcDonaldsonLufkin & Jenrette, she worked as an investment banker. Coming to Oracle in 1999,Catz served as the software giantcs chief financial officer for several yearsand she developed a reputation as being one of Ellisoncs closest and most loyaladvisors.Credit: Bay Area News Groupcc
