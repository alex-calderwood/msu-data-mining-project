HIGHLIGHT: Ms. Haley, the South Carolina governor, was a prominent and frequentcritic of Donald Trump early in his run.President-elect Donald J. Trump on Wednesday named Gov. Nikki Haley of SouthCarolina as his choice to become ambassador to the United Nations, adding to hisprospective cabinet a former critic with whom he had sparred bitterly.Ms. Haley's name had previously been mentioned as a possible contender to becomeMr. Trump's secretary of state, and she met with Trump transition officials lastweek in New York.Her selection was first reported by the The Post and Courier newspaper inCharleston, S.C. The news of Ms. Haley's selection came after days of criticismof Mr. Trump's early picks as a homogeneous bloc of older, white men. Ifconfirmed, Ms. Haley would step down as governor and be replaced by the state'slieutenant governor, Henry McMaster, who was an early and vocal supporter of Mr.Trump.Ms. Haley, 44, supported Senator Marco Rubio of Florida during the Republicanprimaries, and she was a prominent and frequent critic of Mr. Trump early in hisrun.That criticism was thought to have kept her off Mr. Trump's list ofvice-presidential candidates, although her name was mentioned in passing beforehe chose Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana.Ms. Haley called out Mr. Trump in January when she gave the official Republicanrebuttal to President Obama's State of the Union address, and she later took himto task for his failure to condemn groups like the Ku Klux Klan."Some people think that you have to be the loudest voice in the room to make adifference," Ms. Haley said in the State of the Union rebuttal. "That is justnot true. Often, the best thing we can do is turn down the volume."In a follow-up interview on the "Today" show on NBC, Ms. Haley - the daughter ofimmigrants from India - said, "Mr. Trump has definitely contributed to what Ithink is just irresponsible talk."Mr. Trump responded harshly to that address, calling her "weak" on immigrationand noting that she had asked him for campaign contributions."She's very, very weak on illegal immigration," Mr. Trump said. "She's very,very weak on illegal immigration. You can't have that."The following month, she condemned Mr. Trump for not speaking out against whitesupremacy more forcefully.Ms. Haley drew on South Carolina's experience last year with the murder of nineAfrican-Americans in a Charleston church, saying that was exactly the kind ofhate that Mr. Trump refused to repudiate."The K.K.K. came to South Carolina from out of state to protest on ourStatehouse grounds," she said at a rally in Georgia. "I will not stop until wefight a man that chooses not to disavow the K.K.K. That is not a part of ourparty. That is not who we are."Supporters of Mr. Trump were angered that Ms. Haley called him out, and manytook to Twitter and mocked her Indian heritage, making fun of her Indian givenname. Some of that sentiment reappeared on social media once word begancirculating that Ms. Haley was likely to be chosen to be part of the Trumpadministration.Still, in a primary season interview with CNN, Ms. Haley urged Mr. Trump not totake her comments personally, and said that she considered him a friend."I have disagreements with other presidential candidates," Ms. Haley said."There's lots of things, but I will say tone matters, message matters andresponsibility matters."If nominated by Mr. Trump and confirmed by the Senate, Ms. Haley, now in hersecond term as South Carolina governor, would succeed Samantha Power, who hasrepresented the United States at the United Nations since 2013.Related Articles     ·    Jeff Sessions, as Attorney General, Could Overhaul Department He's          Skewered     ·    Ex-General and Critic of Islam to Help Guide Trump in White House     ·    Trump's Choice of Stephen Bannon Is Nod to Anti-Washington Base
