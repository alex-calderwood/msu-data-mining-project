HIGHLIGHT: Publishing houses were caught off-guard by Donald Trump's win onElection Day, and editors, agents and publishers are now racing to acquire workslike memoirs and political analysis.Correction AppendedIn the summer of 2015, Katy Tur, a London-based foreign correspondent for NBCNews, got a surprising offer from the network's head of news coverage. Would shelike to cover Donald J. Trump's presidential campaign? He assured her that itwould be a brief assignment - six weeks at the most.It was one of many assumptions about Mr. Trump's candidacy that proved to bewildly off-base. Ms. Tur was on the campaign trail for 18 months, living out ofa suitcase and subsisting on hard-boiled eggs, packets of peanut butter andfistfuls of Cheez-Its. She became a frequent target of Mr. Trump on Twitter andduring his rallies, where he accused her of dishonesty and called her a"third-rate reporter," and she received death threats from his supporters. Onelection night, expecting to cover his defeat, she instead reported on hisvictory speech.Ms. Tur will recount those experiences in a book, "Unbelievable," which willalso explore Mr. Trump's unexpected rise through the Republican ranks and hisascension to the presidency.Ms. Tur's memoir, which will be published by Dey Street Books next year, is partof a coming deluge of postelection analysis, as agents, editors and publishersrace to acquire books that explain the forces that propelled Mr. Trump tovictory and assess the future of American politics after a caustic andpolarizing election. It is a challenging task, made all the more daunting by thefact that few in the publishing world foresaw Mr. Trump's rise."As book publishers, we have a responsibility to take two steps back from thenowness of it all and find out what's going to be relevant five years from now,"said Julia Cheiffetz, executive editor of Dey Street Books. "It's one of themost extraordinary moments in American history."Some political books and memoirs that were already in the works before ElectionDay will take on new resonance. Random House recently acquired a memoir by KhizrKhan, the Pakistani-American Gold Star father who became a prominent surrogatefor Hillary Clinton after his stirring speech at the Democratic NationalConvention. His memoir, which is scheduled to be published in 2017, will tellthe story of the Khans' move from Pakistan to America; the loss of their son, acaptain in the Army; and their unexpected role in a heated national debate aboutimmigration, patriotism and religious diversity."Their story of what it's like to be a Muslim in America, it feels even morepertinent after the election results," said Ben Greenberg, Random House'sexecutive editor.Other books will examine Mr. Trump's populist appeal and how he capitalized onvoters' economic and social anxiety, or will try to place the Trump phenomenonwithin a growing wave of populist and nationalist movements. The journalistDavid Neiwert's "Militialand USA: The Rise of the Radical Right in the Age ofTrump," to be published by Verso, will examine how Mr. Trump's campaign helpedextreme right-wing voices find a place in the mainstream. This month, AtlanticBooks acquired the BBC broadcaster Steve Richards's "The Rise of the Outsiders:How the Anti-Establishment Is on the March," which will look at the populistsentiments that drove Trump voters and the movement in Britain to exit theEuropean Union.A normal election year brings a barrage of books from campaign reporters,political pundits and academics, ranging from autopsies of the inner workings ofa campaign to wonkier works that explore policies and social issues. There havebeen some breakout campaign books in recent years, including "Game Change" - ajuicy post-mortem of the 2008 election by the political reporters John Heilemannand Mark Halperin, which sold nearly 500,000 print copies according to Nielsen -and books by Obama campaign insiders like David Plouffe and David Axelrod. Andan outgoing administration typically produces a flood of memoirs from cabinetmembers, advisers and, of course, the president and first lady.But this was far from a normal election year. Like many in the media, publishingindustry executives were caught off-guard by the results on Nov. 8, and now findthemselves scrambling."People are curious, and people are baffled, and from the point of view of apublisher that's both an opportunity and a hurdle, because you need to find away to explain what happened," said Peter Osnos, founder of the publishingimprint PublicAffairs, who has worked on books by Barack Obama, Bill Clinton andJimmy Carter. "The big question is who will emerge with something that'scompelling, original, revelatory and provocative."Some publishers say there's little appetite for the traditional blow-by-blowaccount of a contentious campaign that was already the subject of almost nonstopdaily news coverage. (Mr. Halperin and Mr. Heilemann declined to comment onwhether they planned to write a book about the 2016 election.)"It was such an exhausting campaign, and it was so exhaustively covered that youwould really have to come at it in a different way," said John Sterling, aneditor at large at Macmillan.There's an evident hunger among readers for thoughtful and nuanced explanationsof how Mr. Trump rode a tide of discontent among white working-class voters tothe presidency. Immediately after the election, books like J. D. Vance's"Hillbilly Elegy" and George Packer's "The Unwinding," which both examine thecountry's growing cultural and political divisions and the grievances of thewhite working class, shot up on Amazon's best-seller lists. Mr. Vance's book,which has 570,000 copies in print, sold more than 19,000 copies in the weekending Nov. 13, according to Nielsen. Several editors and publishers said theywere eager to acquire more narrative nonfiction books like "Hillbilly Elegy"that take a broader view of cultural and economic forces.Some see an opportunity for writers and publishers to seize on a moment ofuncertainty and take stock of the future of the Democratic and Republicanparties."As surprising as the election was, as gobsmacked as most people were by theresults of it, the really interesting part starts now," Mr. Sterling said.Correction: November 22, 2016, TuesdayThis article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Because of anediting error, an earlier version of a picture caption with this articlemisstated the given name of the NBC News reporter who is writing the book"Unbelievable."
