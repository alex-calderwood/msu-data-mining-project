Failed Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein on Wednesday announcedplans to force a recount of votes in three crucial swing states - a long-shotmove that could help vanquished Democrat Hillary Clinton.Stein, who garnered a dismal 1 percent of the national vote, said challengingthe tallies in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan was essential to answerquestions about a possible cyber-attack on electronic voting machines.She appealed for $2.5 million-plus in donations to pay for the effort, whichwould have to be started by Friday, the deadline for filing papers in Wisconsin.An online counter showed that she had raked in more than $2.2 million indonations by early Thursday, and a Stein campaign lawyer notified the WisconsinElections Commission she intended to seek a recount.There are also deadlines of Monday in Pennsylvania, and next Wednesday inMichigan.All three states went for President Obama in 2012, but President-elect DonaldTrump turned Pennsylvania and Wisconsin red and held a narrow, 10,704-vote leadover Clinton in Michigan as of Wednesday afternoon.Last week, activists reportedly urged Clinton's campaign to force recounts inall three states, citing data showing she got 7 percent fewer votes in Wisconsincounties that used electronic voting machines than in those that relied on paperballots and optical scanners.Clinton has remained mum on the possibility of a recount.Additional reporting by Daniel Halper
