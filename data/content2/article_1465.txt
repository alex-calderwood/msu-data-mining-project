Wells Fargo will offer clients commission-based retirement accounts under thefiduciary rule, according to a company memo sent to advisers, making it thelatest firm to unveil plans for complying with the new regulation.The policy applies to both employee and independent advisers, according to acompany spokeswoman.Several firms, including Morgan Stanley and Ameriprise, are opting to make useof the rule's best contract interest exemption, which permits commission-basedbusiness.With more than 15,000 advisers, Wells Fargo is one of the largest firms to doso. Merrill Lynch, which has 14,000 advisers, has moved in the oppositedirection, saying clients who want commission-based business can opt to useMerrill Edge, its self-directed platform, or its forthcoming robo adviserservice."If a firm doesn't have something like Merrill Edge or an adviser base like thatof Merrill's, then they might come to a different conclusion," Alois Pirker,research director at Aite Group, a Boston-based research firm, said last month.Among the wirehouses, only UBS has not announced whether the firm will keepcommission-based accounts.Executives at many firms have expressed concern about an increased liabilityrisk if they were to permit advisers to use the contract exemption. But, severalindustry analysts have noted that the rule is likely to pinch revenue streamsfor some firms, depending on their business model.But even as wealth management firms have been detailing plans for complying withthe rule, the presidential election has thrown the future of the Department ofLabor's regulation into doubt. Republicans in Congress have expressed theirdesire to overturn the rule, and President-elect Donald Trump has indicated adesire to rollback Obama-era regulations. Wells Fargo acknowledged thisuncertainty in its memo."While there is a great deal of speculation in the media on how the electionresults will affect the DoL rule, none of us can say with certainty what willactually happen. Many different types of scenarios are possible, and we areplanning for all of them. In the meantime, we will continue preparing for anApril 2017 implementation," the company said.A person familiar with the company's fiduciary planning confirms that executivesare moving ahead as if the rule will go into effect. But even if the regulationis overturned next year, it may be wise to make adjustments to how the companydoes business given the momentum a fiduciary standard has had, the person says."I think we'll be living in a fiduciary world three to four years from nowanyways," he says.The firm said it was taking additional measures to comply with the rule,including more documentation of client risk tolerance and intention, as well asinvestment recommendations.Wells Fargo will announce other changes in the coming weeks, according to thememo.The firm may curtail the product range available in retirement accounts,offering clients "more pre-approved solutions," according to the source.URL:http://www.onwallstreet.com/news/wells-fargo-to-keep-commissions-under-fiduciary-rule
