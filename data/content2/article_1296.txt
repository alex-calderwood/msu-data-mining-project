Regarding Trevor Potter's Nov. 20 Outlook essay "How the presidency could be asweet deal for the Trumps":How willing are congressional Republicans to oversee President-elect DonaldTrump's potential ethics issues? The questions raised about former secretary ofstate Hillary Clinton's foreign relationships as they may or may not havebenefited the Clinton Foundation are minuscule compared with what we may seewith the Trump business relationships in foreign countries. Will Rep. JasonChaffetz (R-Utah), the chairman of the House Oversight and Government ReformCommittee, go after Mr. Trump as he did Ms. Clinton?It is time for legislation requiring the president to put all financial holdingsin a true blind trust.  Past presidents have been willing to voluntarily puttheir holdings in blind trusts. Not Mr. Trump. We are clearly in a differentera, one in which presidents can't be trusted to abide by the ethical conductrequired of all other public servants. Mr. Trump should not be allowed to breachthe public trust while in office and to personally profit during his tenure.Joyce Kelly , Ellicott CityIt should come as no surprise  that President-elect Donald Trump refuses to playby the rules. He ran his campaign as an outsider who would be politicallyincorrect, refused to release his income taxes, has a foundation he uses as apersonal piggy bank, has been  sued by countless people, just agreed to pay $25million to settle fraud cases over Trump University, may be using his electedposition to promote his personal properties (the very charge he lobbed atDemocratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton) and now facesconflict-of-interest accusations by not putting his personal investments in ablind trust or liquidating them as previous presidents have done.Mr. Trump has to decide whether he is going to be president or a businessman. Ifhe does not divest himself, there is no doubt that a number of organizationswill take him to court.Joel Lasko , Silver Spring
