HIGHLIGHT: The leading candidates are both high-profile politicians with theirshare of detractors.WASHINGTON - Rival factions of Republicans are locked in an increasingly causticand public battle to influence President-elect Donald J. Trump's choice forsecretary of state, leaving a prominent hole in an otherwise quickly formednational security team that is unlikely to be filled until next week at theearliest.The debate inside Mr. Trump's wide circle of formal and informal advisers -pitting supporters of one leading contender, Mitt Romney, against those ofanother, Rudolph W. Giuliani - has led to the kind of dramatic airing ofdifferences that characterized Mr. Trump's unconventional and often squabblingcampaign team.And it traces the outlines of the enduring split in the Republican Party betweenestablishment figures who scoffed at Mr. Trump's chances of victory and thegrass-roots insurgents who backed him as a disrupter of the Washington powerstructure.The most publicly vocal faction has been the group opposed to Mr. Romney, whichhas questioned whether he would be loyal after his searing criticism of Mr.Trump during the campaign. But Mr. Trump himself has told aides that he believesMr. Romney "looks the part" and would make a fine secretary of state, a seniorTrump official said on Thursday. Mr. Trump, who is always difficult to read andis capable of changing his mind at any minute, has also praised Mr. Giuliani inrecent conversations with acquaintances.Even Thanksgiving did not provide a reprieve from the extraordinary publicefforts to cast doubt on Mr. Romney. Mr. Trump's campaign manager, KellyanneConway, said on Twitter that she had received "a deluge" of concern from peoplewarning against picking Mr. Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee andformer Massachusetts governor.Those raising concerns about Mr. Giuliani, the former New York City mayor and anearly and loyal supporter of Mr. Trump, have said they fear that his tangle offoreign business ties could lead to a damaging confirmation battle. They alsoworry that Mr. Giuliani lacks the vigor for the globe-trotting job.Both Mr. Romney and Mr. Giuliani have made their interest in the role known toMr. Trump. But while Mr. Giuliani has been very public about his intentions -angering Mr. Trump at times with his statements - Mr. Romney has been morereserved.The split over the two men has opened the door for another candidate altogether.One potential pick Mr. Trump and his team have entertained is Gen. John F. Kellyof the Marines, a former head of the United States Southern Command. Others areDavid H. Petraeus, the retired general and former C.I.A. director, and SenatorBob Corker of Tennessee, according to two people involved in the process.Asked about Mr. Trump's deliberations, a spokesman, Jason Miller, said in anemail Thursday, "The president-elect is meeting with a number of well-qualifiedpotential selections for this important position who share his America Firstforeign policy - some of whom have been made public and others who have not -and the president-elect will make public his decision when he has finalized it."Mr. Romney would represent a departure from the hard-liners Mr. Trump hasalready picked for his national security team. But aides like Stephen K. Bannon,Mr. Trump's chief strategist, have expressed doubts about Mr. Romney's loyaltygiven his denunciation of Mr. Trump as a "phony" and a "fraud." Mr. Bannon andothers have told colleagues they fear that a State Department under Mr. Romneycould turn into something of a rogue agency.Asked to explain her Twitter post about Mr. Romney, Ms. Conway said that whileshe trusted Mr. Trump's judgment, she found it notable that the most outragedirected at Mr. Trump from the party's grass-roots "is not against something hesaid, but something he may do." In another post, she said that being "loyal" wasan important characteristic for a secretary of state.Others hoping to catch Mr. Trump's ear have taken their message to a place theyknow he is likely to absorb it: cable news. Joe Scarborough, the MSNBC host, whohas spoken with Mr. Trump about his concerns that Mr. Giuliani would not beconfirmed by the Senate, has taken to making those arguments on a daily basis onhis morning show, which he knows Mr. Trump watches.Others, like Newt Gingrich, the former Republican House speaker, and MikeHuckabee, the former governor of Arkansas, have gone on television to try todissuade Mr. Trump from picking Mr. Romney. Mr. Huckabee, who said during the2008 presidential campaign that Mr. Romney reminded voters of "the guy who laidthem off," told Fox News on Wednesday that picking Mr. Romney would be "a realinsult" to Mr. Trump's supporters. Mr. Giuliani is a favorite of the Republicanvoters who turned out in large numbers to lift Mr. Trump to victory.Sean Hannity, a Fox News host whose opinion Mr. Trump often privately solicits,has also been deeply critical of Mr. Romney on his show.Shortly after the election, Mr. Giuliani told associates that he believed thejob was his. He had communicated to Mr. Trump's top advisers that it was theonly post he was interested in, according to the people briefed on thediscussions.But he began to run afoul of Mr. Trump when he told a Wall Street Journal forumthat he would probably be a better candidate than John R. Bolton, who served asone of George W. Bush's ambassadors to the United Nations.And when reports surfaced about Mr. Giuliani's foreign business entanglementsand highly compensated speechmaking, Mr. Trump grew even warier. His firm,Giuliani Partners, has had contracts with the government of Qatar, and Mr.Giuliani has given paid speeches to a shadowy Iranian opposition group thatuntil 2012 was on the State Department's list of foreign terroristorganizations.As a backup plan, some of Mr. Trump's aides encouraged him to meet with Mr.Romney. Though some in Mr. Trump's inner circle, like Reince Priebus, his choicefor chief of staff, thought that such a meeting would anger thepresident-elect's supporters, Mr. Trump went ahead. In the meantime, he startedsounding out Mr. Giuliani on a different post, director of nationalintelligence. Mr. Trump's advisers have discussed the role for Mr. Giuliani, butthere has been no indication he wants it.What many people believed would be a perfunctory meeting with Mr. Romney lastweekend at Mr. Trump's golf club in Bedminster, N.J., turned into something moresubstantial.Mr. Trump liked Mr. Romney quite a bit, and was intrigued by the possibility ofsuch a camera-ready option to represent the country around the globe, advisersto Mr. Trump said. The following day, Mr. Giuliani met with Mr. Trump and urgedhim to make a decision in one direction or the other.Mr. Romney, who was mocked in 2012 when he described Russia as the greatestgeopolitical foe of the United States, has seen his stock in the RepublicanParty rise since his loss to President Obama, although he is still viewedskeptically by the party's grass-roots. His allies believe that his position onRussia has been vindicated, but it is starkly at odds with Mr. Trump's stateddesire for a better relationship with the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin.Privately, Mr. Giuliani has expressed his frustration at going from front-runnerfor secretary of state to a contender who has to convince Mr. Trump of hisstrengths. He is particularly irritated over the focus on his business ties.The option of a third person like General Kelly has gained currency in recentdays inside the transition team. A respected leader, General Kelly served as thesenior military assistant to former Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta. He ledthe Southern Command, responsible for all United States military activities inSouth and Central America, for four years under Mr. Obama. And his appointmentwould fit Mr. Trump's inclination toward putting people with combat experiencein senior foreign policy roles.Get politics and Washington news updates via Facebook, Twitter and in theMorning Briefing newsletter.Jeremy W.
