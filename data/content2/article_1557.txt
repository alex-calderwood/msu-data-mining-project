People at the camp have said they have no intentions of leaving, atthe same time the corps says it will not enforce an eviction.The Washington Quinault tribe said in a statement it is returning to the campfor the third time, after staging a symbolic canoe journey from Bismarck to thecamp in October and establishing a winter camp at Oceti Sakowin in November.Quinault Tribal President Fawn Sharp said her tribe is fighting to keep Bakkenoil from coming into its shipping ports."We realize this country will continue to need oil for years to come. Butpriority must be placed on the protection of natural resources, treaty rights,cultural resources and the pursuit of clean energy. Water is life," she said.(Reach Lauren Donovan at 701-220-5511 or lauren@westriv.com)
