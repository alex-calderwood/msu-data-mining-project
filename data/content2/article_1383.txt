The Breitbart News Network is seeing some of its advertisers head for the exitdoors and is responding in typical Breitbart fashion: by going on thecounteroffensive, labeling one of them as "un-American" and calling it a war onconservatism.Since Donald Trump's victory in the presidential election, Los Angeles-basedBreitbart has experienced a backlash from some advertisers who say that theonline site conflicts with their corporate values.Breitbart took a pro-Trump stance during the campaign, supporting the Republicancandidate's views on immigration and national security. The company's executivechairman, Steve Bannon, who is on a leave of absence, was Trump's campaignmanager and has been named chief White House strategist.Although Bannon was quoted in Mother Jones as saying Breitbart is a platform forthe alt-right -- the ultraconservative movement associated with whitenationalism -- the news site has denied accusations that it engages in racistrhetoric. The company has stated that it isn't affiliated with the alt-right andthat the brand of nationalism it espouses is political, not racial.Breitbart is fighting back at one of the advertisers -- the breakfast cerealmaker Kellogg Co. -- by launching a Twitter campaign #DumpKelloggs thatencourages its readers to sign a petition and boycott the maker of suchfavorites as Froot Loops and Apple Jacks.On Wednesday, Breitbart placed an article about its #DumpKellogs campaign in thetop slot of its homepage. By early afternoon, the article had drawn more than6,000 reader comments, many in support of the boycott."Kellogg's decision to blacklist one of the largest conservative media outletsin America is economic censorship of mainstream conservative politicaldiscourse. That is as un-American as it gets," Breitbart said in a statement.The site said it has a community of 45 million loyal readers "who are also apowerful consumer group that reflects the values of mainstreet America."In October, the site drew 19.2 million unique visitors, up nearly 50% from 12.9million visitors in the same month last year, according to data from ComScore.The Kellogg Co. said in a statement that it regularly works with media buyingpartners to "ensure our ads do not appear on sites that aren't aligned with ourvalues as set forth in our advertising guidelines."Kellogg's guidelines state that it won't place ads in media that "encouragesoffensive behavior to others, or where the media is not consistent with ourproduct or corporate image."The cereal company said that it advertises on a large number of websites, "sooccasionally something is inadvertently missed. In this case, we learned fromconsumers that ads were placed on Breitbart.com and decided to discontinueadvertising there."It is common for companies to buy online ads through third-party networks or adexchanges that place the ads on numerous sites. As a result, many companies maynot be aware of the sites on which their ads ultimately appear.Other companies that have pulled their ads from Breitbart in recent weeksinclude insurance giant Allstate and the ad exchange AppNexus."We determined that the site violates our hate speech prohibition," said JoshZeitz, a spokesman for AppNexus.He said that Breitbart was never a direct client but that some of AppNexus'technology partners made Breitbart's inventory available on its exchange.A spokeswoman for Allstate declined to comment.It remains unclear how much the loss in ad revenue will hurt Breitbart. Themedia company is privately held and doesn't discuss its business operations. ButChief Executive Larry Solov recently told the Los Angeles Times that the companyrelies on advertising for the majority of its revenue and that it uses multiplead networks.The company said Wednesday that Kellogg's decision "will make virtually norevenue impact." It said the move by Kellogg and other companies represents anescalation in the war "against conservative customers whose values propelledDonald Trump into the White House."Breitbart is rumored to receive significant backing from hedge fund billionaireRobert Mercer, who has been a key supporter of Trump. The site was founded adecade ago by journalist Andrew Breitbart, who died in 2012, and has aneditorial staff of about 100 worldwide.The site has seen a surge in popularity in the months leading up to the electionand is planning to expand its footprint into France and Germany to capitalize onthe nationalist movements gaining steam in Europe as a result of the continent'srefugee crisis.On Wednesday, some of Breitbart's top brass took to social media to take aim atthe advertising defectors, describing Kellogg as "bigotry for breakfast.""Far, far, far more bigotry comes from the left than the right," Alex Marlow,Breitbart's editor in chief, said on Twitter.--david.ng@latimes.comTwitter: @DavidNgLAT
