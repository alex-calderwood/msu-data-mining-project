The Issue: Calls for the abolition of the Electoral College following DonaldTrump's win.One of the main reasons we keep the Electoral College is that it gives smallerstates some say in the presidential election (" 'Outrage' Ulcers," MarkCunningham, PostOpinion, Nov. 19).If we were to go only by the popular vote, the 12 to 15 most populated statescould dominate any national election. One-third of the states could essentiallyrun the entire country.The problem with liberals is that they want a kind of government that doesn'talign with the vision of our Founding Fathers. Sorry, liberals, this is theUnited States. Joseph Saraceno Gardena, Calif.Instead of our current Electoral College, why not assign one electoral vote foreach congressional district that's won?This way, states with big cities, such as New York, California and Illinois,don't always go to one candidate.   Bob Lervolino MuttontownHillary Clinton maintains a 1.6 million-vote margin over Donald Trump.However, if you take away California, which had a 3.4 million-vote margin forClinton, and New York, which had a 1.5 million-vote margin for her, Trump wouldhave won the popular vote.The Founders were wise to not let two states dictate who becomes president.David DiBello BrooklynOne of the main reasons we keep the Electoral College is that it gives smallerstates some say in the presidential election (" 'Outrage' Ulcers," MarkCunningham, PostOpinion, Nov. 19).If we were to go only by the popular vote, the 12 to 15 most populated statescould dominate any national election.
