Regarding the Nov. 17 Metro article "Evangelicals put their faith in Trump":I am an evangelical Christian who voted for Democratic presidential nomineeHillary Clinton. Why? As the Bible tells us, "ye will know them by their acts."Ms. Clinton is a Methodist girl raised up in her church. She listened to theguidance of the Word, was active in her youth group and expressed herChristianity by doing good for others. She has worked for children, the poor andthose less fortunate all of her life.As an American (and Southern Baptist), I believe in the separation of church andstate and believe the government (federal or state) has no business controllingwomen's reproductive health. As for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgenderpeople, Jesus said there is room for all at the table. I take that to heart. TheUnited States is great because it is inclusive. Christianity is great because itis open to all.Jean A. Anspaugh , Fairfax
