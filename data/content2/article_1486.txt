WASHINGTON - President-elect Donald Trump is enlisting a trio of nominees withdeep ties to Washington and Wall Street to fill out his cabinet, includingformer Goldman Sachs executive Steven Mnuchin as secretary of the TreasuryDepartment.On Tuesday, Trump also chose Georgia Rep. Tom Price to oversee the nation'shealth-care system, picking a fierce Obamacare critic who has championed effortsto privatize Medicare. And he selected another veteran Republican, Elaine Chao,a former labor secretary and the wife of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell,to lead the Department of Transportation.Mnuchin's official announcement was expected as early as Wednesday, according toa person familiar with the decision who insisted on anonymity.Mnuchin, 53, a former executive with Goldman Sachs and a movie financier, ledTrump's finance operations during the presidential campaign and become closewith the president-elect. But he has no government experience, which could provea hurdle in navigating the tricky politics of Washington.If confirmed by the Senate, Mnuchin would play a central role in shaping Trump'stax policies and infrastructure plans. He would also lead an agency tasked withimplementing international economic sanctions.Mnuchin is expected to be joined on Trump's senior economic team by anotherfinancier, Wilbur Ross. The billionaire investor is considered the "king ofbankruptcy" for buying beaten-down companies with the potential to deliverprofits.Trump spent much of Tuesday in his Manhattan skyscraper, racing through meetingswith prospective administration hires as high-profile vacancies remain - nonebigger than secretary of state. He emerged in the evening for a private dinnerwith former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, who is on the shortlist for thenation's chief diplomat.Romney spoke briefly to reporters, saying he has "increasing hope" that Trumpcan lead the country to a "better future."Price, picked to lead the Department of Health and Human Services after morethan a decade in Congress, helped craft House Speaker Paul Ryan's plan toprivatize Medicare - a position Trump opposed in the campaign.Price's selection raised questions about the incoming president's commitment toMedicare, among other popular entitlement programs he repeatedly vowed topreserve before the election. The Georgia congressman led GOP efforts on CapitolHill to transform Medicare into a voucherlike system, a change that if enacted,would likely dramatically reduce government spending on the health-care programthat serves an estimated 57 million people.Trump did not address Price's position on Medicare in a statement released byhis transition team. The team did not respond to subsequent questions about it."Chairman Price, a renowned physician, has earned a reputation for being atireless problem solver and the go-to expert on health care policy, making himthe ideal choice to serve in this capacity," Trump said. "He is exceptionallyqualified to shepherd our commitment to repeal and replace Obamacare and bringaffordable and accessible health care to every American."Trump, in a 2015 interview promoted on his campaign website, pledged not to cutexpensive entitlement programs that Republicans have fought for years to cut tohelp reduce the federal deficit."I'm not going to cut Social Security like every other Republican. And I'm notgoing to cut Medicare or Medicaid. Every other Republican's going to cut," Trumptold the Daily Signal.He later changed his mind on Medicaid, embracing the GOP concept of turning theprogram over to the states with a fixed amount of federal "block grant" funding.Like any cabinet official, Price would carry out the wishes of the president.And a sweeping Medicare initiative would have to go through Congress with someDemocratic support, which would be unlikely.Like Price, Chao is well-known in Washington. She was the first Asian Americanwoman to serve in a president's cabinet, as labor secretary under George W.Bush.Her record in that post suggests she would bring a light hand to safetyenforcement as transportation secretary. Under Chao at Labor, the OccupationalSafety and Health Administration didn't issue a single significant new safetyregulation for four years.Mnuchin, Price, and Chao would require Senate confirmation.
