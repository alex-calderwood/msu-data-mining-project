center-left loses its grip on europeClinton, Democrats join a beleaguered clubPARIS - When Donald Trump shocked the world with an upset victory in the U.S.presidential election this month,  much of Europe was aghast.But in at least one critical sense, the result couldn't have been more European:Across the continent, parties of the center-left that have dominated politicsfor decades - and that have given Europe its reputation for generous socialwelfare systems - now find themselves beaten, divided and directionless. HillaryClinton and the Democrats are just the latest members of a beleaguered club.In Germany and Britain, once-mighty center-left parties have been badlydiminished, locked out of their nations' top jobs for the foreseeable future. InSpain and Greece, they have been usurped by newer, more radical alternatives.And in France and Italy, they're still governing - but their days in power maybe numbered. The rout of the center-left has even extended deep intoScandinavia, perhaps the world's premier bastion of social democracy.Overall, the total vote share for the continent's traditional center-leftparties is now at its lowest level since at least World War II. Like theDemocrats, these parties have been marginalized, with little influence overpolicy as the right prepares to place its stamp on the Western world in a waythat could endure for decades."If the left and the center-left don't get their act together, then we'relooking at a period of very unstable right-wing hegemony," said Alex Callinicos,a European studies professor at King's College London.The decline of the European center-left is part of a broader unraveling of thecontinent's  mainstream consensus as electorates fracture and a politicalkaleidoscope of alternatives emerges.But unlike the center-left, traditional parties of the center-right have managedto hold their own amid the populist fury, clinging to power in London, Berlinand Madrid - with a strong chance next year to take Paris, as well.As recently as a decade ago, the picture was very different. Britain's TonyBlair was at the vanguard of a generation of European center-left leaders whohad emulated Bill Clinton's pragmatic Third Way politics and seemed poised toride their marriage of social democracy with market liberalization to anunlimited future of electoral success.But the Great Recession - and the bumpy, deeply unequal recovery that followed -fundamentally changed that."With the economic crisis, and the negative effects of globalization, thesocialists couldn't convince the populations in their respective countries thatthe future lies in a liberal Europe," said Gérard Grunberg, a historian ofsocialism at Sciences Po in Paris. "This is the end of the European utopia."That "utopia" emerged in the aftermath of 1945, when politicians across war-tornEurope banded together to build a new continent that would never repeat thegrave mistakes of the recent past. This was the genesis of the European Union:an economic union that was meant to become, at least in theory, committed to thecommon cause of social justice, largely a leftist ideal.If the three decades that followed World War II coincided with the longestperiod of growth in Europe's history, voters today see neither leftist economicpolicies nor the E.U. itself as necessarily worth preserving. Britain voted toleave the bloc in June, and separatist movements have spread across thecontinent to France, the Netherlands and elsewhere.To historians, the unlikely abandonment of this former European bedrock ispartly a function of its own achievements."It was a failure by success," said Timothy Snyder, a  historian of 20th-centuryEurope at Yale University. "Once the left becomes not revolutionary buttransformative, and once that transformation succeeds, people start taking itfor granted."Europeans take for granted that they will have public education, free healthcare and social services," he said. "And the left doesn't get votes on thisanymore."The marginalization of Europe's center-left parties has been consistent acrossthe continent, although their paths to the political wilderness have varied.In France, prospects for a leftist victory in presidential elections in 2017remain bleak. The perceived failure of the Socialist president, FranÃ§oisHollande, to respond adequately to a recent string of terrorist attacks hasbrought him the lowest approval ratings in modern French history and ignited arebellion in his own party.In particular, Hollande's proposal to strip French citizenship from convictedterrorists who hold dual nationality outraged fellow leftists, distracting theparty from presenting a united front against its opponents.Hollande will face a conservative party whose candidates have promised tobolster national security and bring the country out of economic stagnation. Fornearly the duration of the current Socialist government's tenure, theunemployment rate has hovered at or above 10 percent.In prosperous Germany, the Social Democratic Party's years of playingsecond-fiddle to the center-right-led government of Chancellor Angela Merkelhave diluted its voice. Analysts give it little prospect for victory in nextyear's national elections.In Italy, the center-left Democratic Party occupies a precarious position. PrimeMinister Matteo Renzi has proposed a host of constitutional revisions, whichhave been put to a referendum slated for early December. Renzi has reiteratedhis promise to resign from office if he loses the vote, which the latest pollssuggest he will.In economically devastated Greece, the traditional center-left party, Pasok,finished no better than fourth in a pair of votes last year that saw its supportdrop to the mid-single digits. In both elections, it embarrassingly placedbehind the neo-Nazi Golden Dawn.But rather than swinging to the right, Greek voters went far left, electing andthen reelecting a government led by the Syriza party, a coalition ofTrotskyites, Maoists and other figures once limited to the revolutionary fringewho were thrust into power on a pledge to fight austerity and the unforgivingterms of the country's international bailout.In Spain, voters have divided almost evenly between the long-standingcenter-left party, the Socialists, and an upstart far-left alternative thatdidn't exist three years ago, Podemos. As a result of the split, thecenter-right People's Party was able to squeak back into power after electionsin June.Britain's Labour Party - which built the country's vaunted National HealthService and was riding a streak of 13 years in power as recently as 2010 - hasfaced no similar challenge by an upstart party to its left. Instead, the farleft has taken over Labour from within, through the bomb-throwing backbencherJeremy Corbyn and his astonishing victory in leadership elections last year.Corbyn's win came after two straight national election defeats for Labour and about of soul-searching that mirrors the sort of anxious introspection nowsweeping the Democratic Party in the United States.Faced with the choice of three center-left contenders or the long-shot bid ofCorbyn, Labour members went with a man who had made a career of bucking theLabour hierarchy and who starkly repudiated the centrism embodied by Tony Blair.But there's little sign that Labour's lurch to the left has put it any closer topower. With a possible early election coming next year, polls indicate the partywould lose decisively to the ruling Conservative Party.Corbyn, meanwhile, has struggled to hold his party together as Labour members ofParliament have overwhelmingly said they have no confidence in his leadership.Blair and his allies have argued that Corbyn will simply guide the party tocontinued irrelevance."You win from the center; you win when you appeal to a broad cross section ofthe public; you win when you support business as well as unions," Blair, whoguided the party to three straight national election victories, said in a speechlast year. "You don't win from a traditional leftist position."But center-left parties have an obligation to try something more radical, saidCallinicos, the European political analyst, because the moderate approachthey've been offering hasn't worked."The merger of traditional social democracy with neoliberalism and globalizedfree-market policies has fallen apart in fairly disastrous fashion," he said,suggesting that the turning point was the global financial crash of 2008, whenworking-class voters saw their jobs disappear or their wages stagnate even asthe net worth of the wealthy continued to race ahead.Across Europe, the center-left has had little to offer those voters, who havelooked elsewhere - including the far right.In Britain's June referendum on the European Union, for instance, working-classvoters in traditional Labour strongholds ignored their party's advice to opt tostay in, and instead heeded the call of the anti-immigration U.K. IndependenceParty to vote out.Trump's victory in the United States rested at least in part on a similarphenomenon - a billionaire tycoon using appeals to xenophobia and racism toscoop up support from voters who no longer believe the party of the working manhas their interests at heart. As in the Brexit vote, Trump won certain keystates with the help of working-class voters who had supported Barack Obama, aDemocrat, in 2012.One implication of the growing void on Europe's left could be profound politicalinstability, both within specific countries and geopolitically. Another could bethe emergence of a right-wing stranglehold, based on widespread nostalgia for aworld that, in Snyder's view, never actually existed."All these continental parties are nostalgic for the interwar nation-state,which was a total disaster," he said. "There was never any moment when they werehappy, independent nation-states. There was never such a time, and theirnostalgia is a kind of disguise."If you plunge into that abyss," he added, "very bad things lie ahead."james.mcauley@washpost.comgriff.witte@washpost.comWitte reported from London.
