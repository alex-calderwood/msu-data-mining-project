They're ba-ack!After falling out of favor in Washington, DC, in the nearly 10-year stretchfollowing the bursting of the housing bubble, Goldman Sachs is poised for aremarkable comeback to the corridors of power.After tapping former Goldman partner Steven Mnuchin to be his Treasurysecretary, President-elect Donald Trump now has two former executives of thepowerhouse bank head by Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein (right) in position toformulate the country's fiscal policy.Former Goldman Vice President Stephen Bannon was previously named Trump's chiefstrategist.Goldman's move back to the center of the nation's financial decision-making willbe further cemented if, as expected, current Chief Operating Officer Gary Cohnis named Trump's budget chief.In addition, Anthony Scaramucci, one of Trump's inner-circle transitionadvisers, cut his teeth at Goldman.What makes the Goldman Sachs comeback even more startling is that just overthree weeks ago, Wall Street's smart money had Hillary Clinton winning - andGoldman spending at least another four years sidelined."This just would not have happened if Hillary was elected," said one Goldmansource, noting that she was criticized for making too much money from paidGoldman speeches."Given the campaign rhetoric, [Goldman's return to power] is very ironic," thesource said.During one Republican presidential primary debate, Trump attacked both rival TedCruz, whose wife was a Goldman managing director, and his future generalelection opponent, Clinton, as Goldman pawns.A Goldman spokesman said the bank "has encouraged its employees to give back tothe community while they are working here and after they leave. We are proudthat many have gone on to serve their country."Lawyer Richard Farley, with Kramer Levin, the author of "Wall Street Wars: TheEpic Battles With Washington that Created the Modern Financial System," saidpresidents often turn to Wall Street execs for Treasury secretary because theyare among the only ones who really understand the global economy."I think just understanding the plumbing of the financial system, given howcomplicated it is, makes it almost necessary to have someone who understandsit."The choice of a Goldman alum for Treasury boss did not sit well with everyone."It's a horrid appointment," President Reagan's former Office of Management andBudget Director David Stockman told The Post."We don't need another plenipotentiary from Goldman Sachs and crony capitalistspeculator who made billions off the backs of taxpayers," he said.While President Obama did not tap Goldman execs for the key positions, PresidentGeorge W. Bush named Goldman CEO Henry Paulson his Treasury secretary, andPresident Clinton named Goldman co-Chair Robert Rubin to the same post.jkosman@nypost.com
