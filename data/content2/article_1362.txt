The West's most powerful water managers held an emergency conference call on themorning before Thanksgiving to consider the same question people across thecountry are asking: What will the election of Donald Trump mean for the issuesthey care about?The group desperately wants to formalize new measures that will reduce how muchwater Southwestern states take from the Colorado River and ease pressure on thenation's largest reservoir, the drought-stricken, rapidly shrinking Lake Mead inNevada and Arizona. The water managers want to get it done while the federalofficials they have been working with for years, many of whom are politicalappointees, still have their jobs."What we're driven by is not ideology or what can or should be done by the Obamaadministration versus what the Trump administration might do," said Ted Cooke,general manager for the Central Arizona Project, one of the West's largest wateragencies. Cooke participated in the call along with Mike Connor, the deputysecretary of the Interior; Estevan Lopez, the head of the Bureau of Reclamation;plus state and local officials, including from California."It's just the uncertainty and inertia that exists in any change ofadministration," Cooke said. "I'm sure their replacements will be capable,qualified and competent people, but even the best people need some time to getup to speed. In the meantime, Lake Mead is going glug, glug, glug. So wereaffirmed our commitment to getting this done, if humanly possible, by Jan.20."That, of course, is Inauguration Day, but it has increasingly come to seem likethe edge of a steep cliff for some advocates who want to protect land and waterin the West. While water managers may be driven by practical concerns, advocatesinvolved in other environmental issues worry about politics, and they, too, areacting with urgency in hopes of seeing their priorities approved in the finaltwo months of the Obama administration.Conservation groups are pressing to finalize a variety of rules that would, forexample, limit where oil and gas can be developed near Arches and Canyonlandsnational parks in southern Utah, and where roads can be built in nationalforests in Colorado. Some want President Obama to designate vast andcontroversial new national monuments near the Grand Canyon and in the Bears Earssection of Utah that is home to Native American tribes and sacred sites."These actions would represent significant, longstanding and positive change inthe Rocky Mountain/Colorado Plateau region and would inure to the benefit of allAmericans who cherish their public lands," Heidi McIntosh, managing partner inthe Denver office of the environmental law firm Earthjustice, wrote in responseto an email query.The Obama administration has already taken a striking number of actions justsince election day, including finalizing a rule to reduce methane emissions fromenergy production, a plan to prevent oil and gas development on Montana landthat is important to the Blackfeet tribe, a move to curb gold exploration nearYellowstone National Park and a ban on offshore drilling in the Arctic for fiveyears.These moves were all in the works long before Trump's stunning victory, but theyhave added to the sense that a clock is ticking toward an unknown future. Obamafaced plenty of criticism from environmental groups during his two terms, buthis record appears extraordinarily green in the context of Trump's vows to cutback environmental regulations and open more public lands to energy development.On the campaign trail, Trump regularly questioned climate science and said hewould pull the United States out of the Paris accord for reducing emissions thatcause climate change. This week, he appeared to hedge, saying in an interviewwith the New York Times that there is "some connectivity" between human activityand climate change and that he is "open-minded" on the Paris accord.Then again, in a video Trump released Monday, he said one of his first acts inoffice will be to "cancel job-killing restrictions on the production of Americanenergy, including shale energy and clean coal, creating many millions ofhigh-paying jobs."He also said that for every new regulation created under his administration, twowould have to be eliminated -- a promise that struck many as arbitrary. KenKimmell, president of the Union of Concerned Scientists, called the idea"absurd" and "illegal" and said it "shows a lack of understanding of howregulations are issued."Trump cannot reverse the designation of national monuments. The authority toname them is given to the president by Congress through the Antiquities Act andpresidents have used it for more than a century.Yet, Trump, along with the Republican-controlled House and Senate, would haveenormous power to undo many environmental regulations approved under the Obamaadministration, either by taking executive action or by going through thelengthier federal rule-making process.Thomas McGarity, a professor at the University of Texas School of Law whofocuses on environmental and administrative law, speculated that the new methanerule, which was strongly opposed by the energy industry, was among those thatcould be undone through the little-used Congressional Review Act, which givesCongress the power to more easily do away with certain federal rules not longafter they are made.The Congressional Review Act has been used only once, to undo a rule involvingergonomics and worker health that was passed in 2000 at the end of the Clintonadministration. As the Congressional Research Service noted in a report lastweek, the act is more likely to be used when there is "turnover in party controlof the White House, particularly a turnover in which the incoming presidentshares a party affiliation with a majority in both houses of Congress."That will be the new reality on Inauguration Day."We got the trifecta this time," McGarity said.Kristen Brengel, vice president for government affairs for the National ParksConservation Assn., said an emboldened Congress concerns her most. While Obamahas been in office, Republican lawmakers have faced a veto threat if they triedto push through ambitious measures to reduce environmental regulations andprotections.Brengel's group and others have identified more than 150 pieces of pendingRepublican-backed legislation that, if passed, could undercut programs torestore wildlife populations, make it easier for livestock to graze on publiclands and allow more logging of old-growth trees in Alaska's Tongass NationalForest.Other bills would remove protections for at-risk species, create loopholes forclimate emissions, remove funding for stream protection near coal mines andallow more aggressive tactics for hunting bears, to name just a few."President Trump wouldn't have to think a lot about it," Brengel said. "He couldjust sign off on the bills. Just like that."--william.yardley@latimes.comTwitter: @yardleyLAT
