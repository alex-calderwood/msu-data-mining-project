WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. - President-elect Donald Trump claimed without evidenceSunday that "millions" voted illegally in the national election, scoffing atHillary Clinton's nearly 2 million edge in the popular vote and returning to hiscampaign mantra of a rigged race even as he prepares to enter the White House inless than two months.Trump and his lieutenants assailed an effort - now joined by Clinton - torecount votes in up to three battleground states, calling the push fraudulent,the work of "crybabies" and, in Trump's estimation, "sad."The president-elect went on to cast a shadow over the legitimacy of an electionthat he actually won, tweeting that "I won the popular vote if you deduct themillions of people who voted illegally." He further contended that if thepopular vote determined the presidency, "It would have been much easier for meto win" it because he would have altered his campaign to pile up overall votetotals, not Electoral College votes.There's been no indication of widespread vote manipulation, illegal voting orhacking that materially affected the outcome one way or the other. It's thatvery lack of evidence that suggests Trump is likely to prevail in recounts.As Trump worked to fill foreign policy and national security posts in hisCabinet, a top adviser expressed astonishment that 2012 GOP presidential nomineeMitt Romney remained under consideration for secretary of state after hiscampaign-long questioning of Trump's character, intellect and integrity.Trump on Sunday tweeted part of Clinton's concession speech, when she toldsupporters they must accept that "Donald Trump is going to be our president,"and snippets from her debate remarks, when she denounced the Republican nomineefor refusing to say in advance that he would accept the Election Day verdict.This came on top of his saying it was a "scam" that Green Party nominee JillStein was revisiting the vote count in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania.Trump won Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, and as of Wednesday, held a lead of almost11,000 votes in Michigan, with the results awaiting state certification Monday.His Michigan margin was a hair's breadth 0.22 percent of the state's votes.Clinton leads the national popular vote by close to 2 million votes, but Trumpwon 290 electoral votes to Clinton's 232, not counting Michigan. She couldconceivably tip the electoral balance in the remote event that all flipped toher in recounts.Trump planned to return to New York on Sunday after spending Thanksgivingweekend at his West Palm Beach estate. His transition team said thepresident-elect had scheduled a series of meetings today with prospectiveadministration hires.Among the jobs Trump has yet to fill: secretary of state. Internal division overthe position again spilled out into the open on Sunday as Trump senior adviserKellyanne Conway voiced her concerns with the possibility of Romney landing sucha significant position.Trump supporters "feel a bit betrayed that you can get a Romney back in thereafter everything he did," Conway said. "We don't even know if he voted forDonald Trump. He and his consultants were nothing but awful to Donald Trump fora year." She added that she was "reflecting what the grassroots are saying."Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani and Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker are amongother prospects to serve as the country's top diplomat."I'm all for party unity, but I'm not sure we have to pay for that with thesecretary of state position," Conway said.Trump's incoming chief of staff, national party Chairman Reince Priebus,acknowledged that Romney would represent "a team of rivals concept."
