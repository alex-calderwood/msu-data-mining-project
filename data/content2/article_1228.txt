Good or bad, however you feel about the election of Donald Trump, it is nothingnew in history.Indeed, despite claims that Trump's election is the biggest upset ever, HarryTruman's election in 1948 was a far bigger upset. Truman was such an underdogthat pollsters stopped polling weeks before the election, convinced that theRepublican Thomas Dewey would defeat the Democrat Truman in a landslide.The pro-Dewey Chicago Daily Tribune even published its election issue with theheadline Dewey Defeats Truman before the returns were in (and the next day theeasily re-elected Truman gleefully displayed that issue for all to see).That said, the Trump-Truman comparison is instructive because both men werecontroversial, and to those worried that Trump will exceed his presidentialpowers, Truman often exceeded his. On several occasions he took control ofentire industries, including settling a nationwide steelworkers strike byunilaterally seizing the nation's steel mills. In the 1946 mid-term elections,the Democratic Party lost both branches of Congress, for which the unpopularTruman was largely blamed.Granted, on balance Truman was a first-rate president, but that didn't stopmillions of Americans from seeing his election in 1948 as the ruination of thecountry, just as today millions think the same of Trump.The Founding Fathers anticipated all of this. In the Federalist Papers writtento explain the Constitution, James Madison wrote that presidential candidateswould not always be "enlightened statesmen," which is why the Founders created agovernment in which the power of each branch of the government, including theexecutive branch, would be checked and balanced by the power of the otherbranches.Further, there is the ultimate sovereign power of the people themselves, whoultimately decide who will serve in our government. In 1946, the people gaveRepublicans a majority in the legislative branch partly because they disapprovedof the policies of the Democrat who headed up the executive branch.In two midterm elections, 2010 and 2014, they did the same to President Obama.If Donald Trump pursues unpopular policies unchecked by his Republican Congress,he, and the Republican Congress, also will face the voters' displeasure.As well as face the displeasure of the judicial branch, which the Foundersspecifically created to check unconstitutional violations of the people's rightsby the legislative and executive branches. The Supreme Court eventually ruledthat Truman's nationalizing the steel mills was an unconstitutional overreach,and they will keep a watchful eye on Trump as well."If angels were to govern men, neither external nor internal controls ongovernment would be necessary," Madison wrote. But since we are governed byimperfect humans, including all of our presidents, such controls are in place.Email Kauffmann at bruce@historylessons.net or follow him on Twitter@BruceKauffmann .
