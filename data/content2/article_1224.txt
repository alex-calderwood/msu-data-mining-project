HIGHLIGHT:Â Searches for travel to Canada increased dramatically after theAmerican election. Here are trips and packages designed to show off the country.For some United States residents, Canada is an increasingly attractive vacationdestination and, possibly, a country to live in.Do Americans really want to move to Canada? It certainly looks that way, atleast since the United States presidential election.Canada's immigration site crashed on election night, and statistics from theairfare predictor app Hopper show that between midnight and 1 a.m. Eastern onNov. 9, the time period when the news media reported that President-elect DonaldJ. Trump had taken the lead in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, there was a210 percent spike in searches for one-way flights to Canada among eight UnitedStates and Canadian airlines, including Delta, American Airlines and PorterAirlines.And, according to data from the travel search engine Kayak, there was a 13percent increase in flight searches from the United States to Canada for threedays after the election, compared with the same period the previous week.Whether the immediate postelection effect of Canada's appeal as a permanent homeis here to stay remains to be seen.But heading there for a getaway is more of an established trend: From Januarythrough August of this year, the number of visitors from the United States toCanada increased 9.4 percent, to 9.8 million people, compared with the sameperiod last year, according to Destination Canada, Canada's national tourismmarketing organization. Also, Kayak saw a 15 percent increase in flight searchesfrom the United States to Canada between Jan. 1 and Nov. 22 this year comparedwith the same time frame in 2015.The surge, said Adam Weissenberg, the head of travel, hospitality and leisure atDeloitte & Touche, is likely caused by the strength of the United States dollaragainst the Canadian dollar. "Canada is a bargain for Americans to visit rightnow and is the best deal it has been in a while," he said.Numbers from the New York City-based economic research firm Oxford Economicsshow that this value proposition is true: the United States dollar appreciatedaround 25 percent against the Canadian dollar from the second quarter of 2013 tothe second quarter of 2016 (the latest exchange rate is around 1 United Statesdollar to around 1.35 Canadian dollars).Here are five trips that may inspire you to vacation in Canada:Fairmont Jasper Park Lodge in Alberta is offering the Jasper Family SkiExperience over the winter.
