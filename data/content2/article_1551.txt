Donald Trump suggests any flag burners should receive 'consequences'WASHINGTON (AP) - President-elect Donald Trump said Tuesday that anyone whoburns an American flag should face unspecified "consequences," such as jail or aloss of citizenship. But the Supreme Court has held that flag-burning is a formof speech protected by the First Amendment, and the Constitution forbids thegovernment removal of citizenship for a natural-born American.Top congressional Republicans quickly distanced themselves from Trump's views.Trump's words, expressed on Twitter early Tuesday morning, put him at odds withthe late Justice Antonin Scalia, who was in the majority in the 1989 decisionthat protected flag burning. Trump has called Scalia, who died in February, agreat judge and said he would appoint someone to fill Scalia's seat who is muchlike the conservative legal icon.Some voters, stung by election result, stirred to new actionNEW YORK (AP) - Three weeks out from a presidential election result that leftthem deeply dejected, many liberals now say they've been roused to action in newways, from making donations and volunteering to considering political runsthemselves.Around the country, even as protests have waned, Democrats say the sting of losshas left an impact unlike any past race, stirring previously passive citizens topush beyond their initial tears and angry Facebook posts following DonaldTrump's win.
