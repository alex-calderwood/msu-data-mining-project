Keith Ellison, D-Minn., the odds-on favorite to become the DemocraticNational Committee's chairman, had a long association with the anti-SemiticNation of Islam. He compared then-President George W. Bush and 9/11 to AdolfHitler and the destruction of the Reichstag, the German parliament building:"9/11 is the juggernaut in American history and it allows ... it's almost like,you know, the Reichstag fire," Ellison said. "After the Reichstag was burned,they blamed the Communists for it, and it put the leader of that country(Hitler) in a position where he could basically have authority to do whatever hewanted."Comparing Republicans to Nazis has long been a national pastime of theDemocratic Party.During the 1964 Goldwater/Johnson presidential race, Republican presidentialcandidate Barry Goldwater accepted an invitation to visit an American militaryinstallation located in Bavaria, Germany. On "CBS Evening News," hosted byWalter Cronkite, correspondent Daniel Schorr said: "It is now clear that Sen.Goldwater's interview with Der Spiegel, with its hard line appealing toright-wing elements in Germany, was only the start of a move to link up with hisopposite numbers in Germany." The reaction shot -- when the cameras returned toCronkite -- showed the "most trusted man in America" gravely shaking his head.When Goldwater accepted the Republican nomination, Democratic California Gov.Pat Brown said, "The stench of fascism is in the air."About Ronald Reagan, Steven F. Hayward, author of "The Age Of Reagan" wrote:"Liberals hated Reagan in the 1980s. Pure and simple. They used language thatwould make the most fervid anti-Obama rhetoric of the Tea Party seem like, well,a tea party. Democratic Rep. William Clay of Missouri charged that Reagan was'trying to replace the Bill of Rights with fascist precepts lifted verbatim fromMein Kampf.'"After Republicans took control of the House in the mid-90s, Rep. John Dingell,D-Mich., compared the newly conservative-controlled House to "the Duma and theReichstag," referring to the legislature set up by Czar Nicholas II of Russiaand the parliament of the German Weimar Republic that brought Hitler to power.About President George W. Bush, billionaire Democratic contributor George Sorossaid, "(He displays the) supremacist ideology of Nazi Germany," and that hisadministration used rhetoric that echoes his childhood in occupied Hungary."When I hear Bush say, 'You're either with us or against us,'" Soros said, "itreminds me of the Germans." He also said: "The (George W.) Bush administrationand the Nazi and communist regimes all engaged in the politics of fear. ...Indeed, the Bush administration has been able to improve on the techniques usedby the Nazi and communist propaganda machines."Former Vice President Al Gore said: "(George W. Bush's) executive branch hasmade it a practice to try and control and intimidate news organizations, fromPBS to CBS to Newsweek. ... And every day, they unleash squadrons of digitalbrown shirts to harass and hector any journalist who is critical of thePresident."Actor/singer and activist Harry Belafonte, who marched with Dr. Martin LutherKing Jr., called Bush a racist. When asked whether the number and prominence ofblacks in the Bush administration perhaps suggested a lack of racism, Belafontesaid, "Hitler had a lot of Jews high up in the hierarchy of the Third Reich."NAACP Chairman Julian Bond played the Nazi card several times. Speaking athistorically black Fayetteville State University in North Carolina in 2006, Bondsaid, "The Republican Party would have the American flag and the swastika flyingside by side."Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, who dared to rein in excessive public employeecompensation packages, received the full Nazi treatment. The hard-left blogLibcom.org posted in 2011: "Scott Walker is a fascist, perhaps not in theclassical sense since he doesn't operate in the streets, but a fascistnonetheless. ... He is a fascist, for his program takes immediate and direct aimat (a sector of) the working class."After the 2012 Republican National Convention, California Democratic PartyChairman John Burton said, "(Republicans) lie, and they don't care if peoplethink they lie. As long as you lie, (Nazi propaganda minister) Joseph Goebbels-- the big lie -- you keep repeating it."The chairman of the South Carolina Democratic Party, Dick Harpootlian, in 2012,compared the state's Republican governor to Hitler's mistress. When told thatthe Republicans were holding a competing news conference at a Nascar Hall ofFame basement studio, Harpootlian told the South Carolina delegation: "(Gov.Nikki Haley) was down in the bunker, a la Eva Braun."If not the Nazi card, it's the race card or the sexist card or the homophobiccard. This "I'm right; you're evil" brand of politics has a lot to do with whyvoters elected Donald Trump, rather than Hillary "basket of deplorables"Clinton, to serve as our next president.
