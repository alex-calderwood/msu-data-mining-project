EVEN TEAM Trump can't explain his comment that there were millions of fraudulentvotes in the presidential election.Asked for proof of the President-elect's claim, Trump spokesman Jason Millercited a widely debunked Washington Post blog post and a Pew Charitable Trustsreport from 2012 - and that report's author said Trump's camp has its factswrong.Responding to Green Party leader Jill Stein's push for election recounts inthree states, Trump tweeted over the weekend that he "won the popular vote ifyou deduct the millions of people who voted illegally."He also claimed there was "serious voter fraud in Virginia, New Hampshire andCalifornia," although officials in all three states say there wasn't.In a conference call with reporters Monday morning, Miller blasted Stein'sefforts as a "frivolous fund-raising scheme" before singling out the 2014 blogpost and the Pew report, which found "that approximately 1 in 8 voterregistrations are no longer valid."But that report's author said they found no evidence of voter fraud."As primary author of the report the Trump camp cited today, I can confirm thatreport made no findings re: voter fraud," David Becker, Pew's former director ofelection initiatives, tweeted Monday. "We found millions of out-of-dateregistration records due to people moving or dying, but found no evidence thatvoter fraud resulted."Trump's claims that millions of people had voted illegally seemed to stem notfrom the reports Miller cited Monday, but from a Nov. 13 tweet from GreggPhillips, a board member of the conservative anti-voter-fraud group True theVote, that claimed without evidence that it "verified more than 3 million votescast by noncitizens."White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Monday, "There has been no evidenceproduced to substantiate a claim like that."
