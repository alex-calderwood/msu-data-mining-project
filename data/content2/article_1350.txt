President-elect Donald Trump spent more than a year promising to build a wall,repeal Obamacare and rescind President Obama's deportation protections for someimmigrants in the U.S. illegally.But on Monday, in his first extensive public comments since winning theelection, Trump mentioned none of those issues. Nor did he talk aboutwithdrawing from the North American Free Trade Agreement, banning Muslims fromentering the country or ending the Syrian refugee program, some of his otherstock campaign pledges.Trump instead made five more modest promises for his first day in office duringa nearly three-minute video. It appeared to be an effort to soften his messagewhile he establishes an inner circle of hard-liners, including Stephen K.Bannon, a top advisor who ran a website that has promoted white nationalistideology.In the video, Trump promised to withdraw from the massive Trans-PacificPartnership trade deal, "a potential disaster for our country," and insteadpursue bilateral agreements with some of the countries involved.He also pledged to lift restrictions on energy production, including shale andcoal, to implement a rule that any new government regulation must be accompaniedby removing two on the books, and to instruct his Joint Chiefs of Staff todevelop a new cybersecurity plan. His only discussion of immigration involvedthe legal kind -- a crackdown on visa fraud."My agenda will be based on a simple core principle: putting America first," hesaid. "Whether it's producing steel-building cars or curing disease, I want thenext generation of production and innovation to happen right here on our greathomeland -- America."Trump also said his previously announced ethics rules -- barring those who workin his administration from lobbying for five years after they leave thegovernment and from lobbying for foreign governments for life -- would takeeffect as soon as he is inaugurated.Trump vowed in the video to release more plans in the days ahead."These are some of our Day One executive actions," spokesman Jason Miller saidin an email. "By no means is it everything he'll work on Day One or after that-- many additional good things to come."Trump's first installment, though, seemed especially tailored to the voters inthe former Industrial Belt who helped him seize his surprise victory.His focus on legal immigration was particularly striking and in line with theviews of Alabama Republican Sen. Jeff Sessions, his pick for attorney generaland one of Trump's earliest supporters in Washington. Sessions has been a criticof the visa system, arguing that work visas, in particular, allow foreignworkers to displace Americans. He has also sponsored a bill that would end thevisa lottery that grants tens of thousands of green cards a year.Trump did not discuss plans to deport millions of immigrants, as he frequentlydid on the campaign trail. But the omissions were far from a declaration of anew agenda and left open the possibility that Trump may be recognizing thedifficulty of achieving all of his ambitions immediately and trying to delaysome of his most divisive proposals."There's nothing he can really do about the wall on Day One," said Jack Pitney,a political science professor at Claremont McKenna College, referring tobuilding a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. "He's probably focusing on narrow,achievable goals that won't cause too much controversy before Thanksgiving.There will be plenty of trouble down the line."Trump has yet to give a post-election news conference laying out his agenda oranswering questions about his transition, which gives added weight to the video.He also addressed criticisms about the disorganized nature of the transition,insisting it has gone "very smoothly, efficiently and effectively."The video came amid news reports that fueled more uncertainty over how Trumpwill avoid conflicts of interest in his worldwide business ties, with newquestions arising Monday over a conversation Trump had last week with ArgentinePresident Mauricio Macri.During a congratulatory call, Trump asked for help with permitting aconstruction project he is building in Buenos Aires, an Argentine journalistsaid.Trump's transition staff and the Argentine government both denied the projectwas discussed. However, Macri's spokesman, Ivan Pavlovsky, said in a statementthat the two men "briefly mentioned the personal relationship they have had foryears," alluding to their business ties, which date back to the 1980s.Trump's transition team did not respond to a request for a transcript or summaryof the call and have denied that Trump's businesses have created even aperception of potential conflict.But Trump's ongoing involvement in his companies raises the specter that he willuse his position to further his financial interests. And the problem will not goaway unless Trump puts a stronger firewall between his family and his businessduring his presidency, ethics specialists say.Even if Trump does not ask for it, foreign leaders may believe they are winninginfluence with Trump by granting business favors to him or his children, whoTrump says will control his businesses while he is president."Private interest currying favor and buying influence with leaders of countriesby dealing with their children is a time-honored tradition in the world," saidFred Wertheimer, president of Democracy 21, a nonpartisan group.Wertheimer called Trump "a massive walking conflict of interest" and saidquestions surrounding his relationship with Macri would occur regularly unlessTrump divests his business empire completely and creates a truly blind trustthat does not involve his children, who are also key political advisors.The issue dogged Trump before he was elected. He ran largely on an ethicsplatform, saying Hillary Clinton and her husband had enriched themselves fromgovernment service and exchanged access at the State Department for cash.Trump has also promised to "drain the swamp," eliminating outside influence inWashington.Trump advisor Kelly-anne Conway scoffed Monday when asked how long Trump wouldcontinue conducting business during the transition."Do you ask people how long they will play golf and do the transition?" shesaid, an implicit dig at President Obama, whose rounds of golf are a frequenttarget of conservative criticism. "Are you suggesting he is doing somethingillegal? I already said he is not. But the presumption is that he is."Conway said Trump had consulted on ethics with lawyers, accountants andadvisors. She said that his role as a businessman in transition to the highestoffice marked "unprecedented times."--noah.bierman@latimes.comtracy.wilkinson@latimes.comSpecial correspondent Laura Tillman in Mexico City and Times staff writer ChrisMegerian contributed to this report.
