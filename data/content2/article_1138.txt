HIGHLIGHT: The interview gets canceled in the morning, as do the train tickets.Then it's back on, and everybody scrambles in a race from D.C. to New York.Times Insider delivers behind-the-scenes insights from The New York Times.WASHINGTON - The day started early. Four of us from the Washington bureau werepart of a team set to interview President-elect Donald J. Trump over lunch atThe New York Times headquarters in Manhattan. Our first step? Get to New York.Our plan was easy: Take Amtrak's 8 a.m. Acela, the high speed train from D.C. toNew York Penn Station, and walk eight blocks up 8th Avenue to the Timesbuilding. The train was scheduled to arrive shortly before 11 a.m., well aheadof the 1 p.m. start to the luncheon interview. We planned to strategize on thetrain about potential questions and follow-ups for Mr. Trump, and could write onour laptops if other news broke that morning.Then Mr. Trump tweeted at 6:16 a.m.:I cancelled today's meeting with the failing @nytimes when the terms andconditions of the meeting were changed at the last moment. Not nice - Donald J.Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 22, 2016A flurry of emails ensued. "Really? Is this fake news? It matters for whatoutfit I choose," wrote Julie Hirschfeld Davis, a fellow White Housecorrespondent."At least he had the good manners to do it before we got on the train!" wroteMark Landler, another member of our White House team.Eventually, there was a decision. We would all cancel our train tickets andregroup at the bureau, two blocks from the White House. (That proved to be afateful move.) "Dean says meeting definitely canceled," Elisabeth Bumiller, theWashington bureau chief, emailed.Elisabeth and I got to the bureau early and turned our attention to a morningtelevision appearance by one of Mr. Trump's senior advisers suggesting that thepresident-elect no longer wanted to pursue charges against Hillary Clinton, achange from his heated rhetoric during the campaign. Mark and Julie worked fromhome, shifting to what passes for a traditional workday in the postelectionperiod.And then, at 9:13 a.m., came an email from our publisher's executive assistant:"Updated Invitation: It's still happening." Arthur Sulzberger Jr., The Times'spublisher, had apparently contacted Mr. Trump's office and convinced him toreconsider. Mr. Trump later tweeted (at 10:40 a.m.): "The meeting with the@nytimes is back on."What followed was a logistical nightmare: How could we get from Washington toNew York in time to meet with Mr. Trump? I logged onto the American Airlineswebsite to no avail; the site wouldn't book a flight with less than an hourbefore departure. Mark had similar trouble. Julie, though, had better luck: Shecalled our travel service and got a seat on a plane, and was soon in a cab toReagan National Airport.Elisabeth and I jumped into a cab at 9:30 as Nicholas Fandos, the bureau'sintrepid clerk, called the travel service to book us tickets on the 10 a.m.Acela, which was scheduled to get into New York at 12:48 p.m. A $20 cab ridelater, and with minutes to spare, we boarded the train. Julie made her flightthanks to a 40-minute delay at the airport. Mark, who lives further out in ChevyChase, got stuck in Washington.Our plans for polishing our interview approach fell by the wayside. Elisabethand I prioritized 10 questions and emailed them to Julie and to Maggie Haberman,our New York-based White House correspondent, who managed to print them out justbefore the interview started.The Acela pulled into Penn Station a few minutes late, arriving at 12:55 p.m. Webounded up the escalators, across the plaza to Eighth Avenue and 33rd Street andstarted jogging. By the time we reached 36th street, a cab pulled up to letsomeone off. Elisabeth and I jumped in, hoping that it might be faster. Itwasn't. At 39th Street, as the interview with Mr. Trump started, we handed overanother $20 bill, jumped out and started running again.At the Times building, the elevators were crowded and slow. After a maddeningride to the 16th floor (and a quick screening by the Secret Service), Elisabethand I entered the boardroom, about eight minutes late.Meanwhile, Julie was having her own delays. After landing on time at La GuardiaAirport, she hopped into a cab, bound for the office. That worked until traffic- perhaps made even worse than usual because of Mr. Trump's motorcade - groundto a halt at 37th Street, along with Julie's cab.She arrived at the interview a few minutes after Elisabeth and me, but in timeto ask Mr. Trump about Stephen K. Bannon, the president-elect's choice for chiefWhite House strategist. "I apologize for my delayed flight," she told thepresident-elect.After the lunch, and Mr. Trump's departure, Julie, Elisabeth and I hunkered downin the boardroom to write. Initially, the spread of food (salmon, beeftenderloin, frisée salad, barley salad with dried fruit) remained, but it wasquickly cleaned up and taken away.Shortly after 7:30 p.m., stories mostly finished, the three of us packed up andheaded for the third-floor newsroom to check in. Dean Baquet, the paper'sexecutive editor, had "a few small thoughts," most of which were fairlypainless. Editors checked quotes in the story against the interview transcript,which was finally completed.Elisabeth ran for the 9 p.m. train back to Washington, where she needed to catcha flight in the morning. Julie and I booked rooms at a nearby hotel and boughttickets on Wednesday's 9 a.m. train.Another eventful transition day done.Follow Times Insider on Twitter.Related Articles     ·    Less Defiant Trump at The Times: 'I Hope We Can All Get Along'     ·    Donald Trump's New York Times Interview: Full Transcript     ·    Trump's Most Important Quotes From His Times Interview, and Why They          Matter     ·    Audio: Inside the Room With President-Elect Donald Trump     ·    Trump, in Interview, Moderates Views but Defies Conventions     ·    Donald Trump's New York Times Interview in 12 Tweets
