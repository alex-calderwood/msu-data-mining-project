Following the ugliest presidential election campaign in modern history, thereare many losers. Civility tops the list. And truth. But perhaps the biggestloser of all was the Earth. We don't know the future, but one thing is clear:action around climate change has to happen at the local, grass-roots level.Many people ask, "As an individual, what can I possibly do to make a differencefor climate change?" And my answer is invariably the same: The single mosteffective thing we can do is encourage our civic leaders to municipalize ourelectric utility. This will enable local control, increase innovation anddistributed supply, and provide a rapid pathway to renewable fossil-freeelectricity. Building on a decade's work from a broad consensus of the community, a cleanerenergy future is in sight. A legitimate separation plan from Xcel is before thePublic Utilities Commission. The economics look promising. What is needed now isthe political will to follow through. Make no mistake, well-meaning but powerful corporate, libertarian, andgarden-variety anti-government forces are hoping to derail the municipalizationeffort. Their tactic is to force a "settlement" with Xcel, which might inch uscloser to our renewable goals, but will inevitably leave out local control andthe vital innovation that could boost our local energy economy. If you care about climate change, now's the time to speak up. Tell the councilto stay the course ( council@bouldercolorado.gov) and let them know you havetheir backs. Tell businesses to get involved in bringing clean energy toBoulder. Our national leaders may put climate change on the back burner. Let'sprove that local action can make a difference.
