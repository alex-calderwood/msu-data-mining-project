HILLARY CLINTON is with Jill Stein in the recount effort.A lawyer for the Clinton campaign said the team will participate in any recountrequest the Green Party presidential nominee files - but it won't spearhead anyof its own."Now that a recount has been initiated in Wisconsin, we intend to participate inorder to ensure the process proceeds in a manner that is fair to all sides,"Marc Elias, general counsel to the Clinton campaign, said in a statementSaturday.Stein, the Green Party presidential nominee, filed for a recount in WisconsinFriday. She has vowed to do the same in Pennsylvania and Michigan, raising morethan $4 million to fund the trio of do-overs.President-elect Donald Trump won all three of those states with narrow margins.However, Clinton won the popular vote by a margin of more than 2 million.The Clinton campaign will go along with Stein's other two recounts, too, if shefiles for them. The deadline to petition Pennsylvania for a recount is Monday,while Michigan's is Wednesday.Elias said the Clinton campaign did not initiate the costly recount processbecause it found no evidence that the results had been altered.In the two weeks since the election, multiple theories have suggested hackerstwisted the results to disadvantage Clinton - but the campaign's owninvestigations couldn't find any signs of interference.Elias admitted that the odds of a recount overturning any of those state's votesare slim. "But regardless of the potential to change the outcome in any of thestates, we feel it is important, on principle, to ensure our campaign is legallyrepresented in any court proceedings and represented on the ground in order tomonitor the recount process itself," Elias said.Meanwhile, Trump slammed Stein, dismissing her fund-raising for the recount as away to "fill her coffers with money.""The people have spoken and the election is over," Trump said in a statement."This is a scam by the Green Party for an election that has already beenconceded, and the results of this election should be respected instead of beingchallenged and abused, which is exactly what Jill Stein is doing."Trump's campaign manager dismissed the recount effort with even strongerlanguage."What a pack of sore losers," Kellyanne Conway said. "After asking Mr. Trump andhis team a million times on the trail, 'Will HE accept the election results?' itturns out Team Hillary and their new BFF Jill Stein can't accept reality."The Clinton campaign's pledge to support the recount comes more than two weeksafter the former secretary of state conceded the Nov. 8 election.Clinton reportedly called Trump (inset) to congratulate him only after PresidentObama urged her to accept the results.When the Republican took Pennsylvania, ensuring that he'd get the needed 270Electoral College votes to win the White House, Clinton took the President'sadvice."Just give me the phone," a frustrated Clinton reportedly told her staffers."I'm calling him."Graphic:Battle for the Badger StateTrump 47.9% 1,409,467Clinton 46.9% 1,382,210Stein 1.1% 30,980Source: CNN
