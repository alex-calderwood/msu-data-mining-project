HIGHLIGHT:Â Activists against undocumented arrivals claim victory and say theyare eager to see what's next.For two weeks, as Americans processed Donald Trump's upset victory in thepresidential race, the banner leading the Minuteman Project's website has beenunequivocally triumphant:"Trump Wins! Minuteman Project Mission Accomplished!"Founded in the mid-2000s by Orange County resident Jim Gilchrist, the Minutemanorganization once was synonymous with hard-line opposition to illegalimmigration. Gilchrist and, later, others urged fellow citizens to patrol theborder to block people from crossing, even as they espoused swift expulsion ofall undocumented immigrants from the United States.Those views once were viewed as extreme. Today, they're a key force in the riseof Trump."We planted the seed in people's minds that the rule of law was at risk,"Gilchrist said last week at a Laguna Niguel coffee bar."And people decided that they wanted something different."Gilchrist's views aren't rare. Many in the anti-illegal immigration movement - apush that has been waning in California since the mid-1990s - view Trump'selection as the culmination of a long, sometimes lonely, fight against what theysee as a crisis of unchecked immigration, both legal and illegal.In Trump, they found a champion who made their cause the central message of hiscampaign."When we started, I really thought that we might have a president who believedthey would enforce immigration laws, but then I began to doubt it," said RoyBeck, executive director of NumbersUSA, a lobbying group based in Washington,D.C., that seeks to reduce immigration levels."So I was shocked that Trump won; I would say that we are pleasantly surprised."NOT CLOSE TO HOMETrump's immigration plans - and the views of his supporters - could face stiffresistance in Orange, Los Angeles and Riverside counties.Hillary Clinton carried California nearly 2-1, and the state is a key reason whyshe won the popular vote by, at last count, at least 1.3 million Americans.Even Orange County, once viewed as reflexively Republican and the birthplace formany anti-immigrant efforts, picked Clinton over Trump by 5 points.Polls consistently show that California voters hold more liberal views onimmigration than the rest of the country, and overwhelmingly oppose thehard-line measures proposed by Trump.According to a USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times survey taken in March, more thanthree-quarters of California voters think immigrants already living in the U.S.should be allowed to stay, and 65 percent think they should be given a pathwayto citizenship. The poll also showed that Californians overwhelmingly oppose aborder wall.But some local anti-illegal immigration activists believe that could change.Trump's victory has reinvigorated their movement, they say, and at least somefeel personally vindicated by Trump's success."Nobody wanted to talk about this, and nobody wanted to hear us," said Anaheimresident Elaine Proko. "We were not politically correct."A veteran anti-illegal immigration activist, Proko was a founding member of theCalifornia Coalition for Immigration Reform, an Orange County-based group thatorchestrated the 1994 passage for Proposition 187, a measure that would have cutoff public services to undocumented immigrants living in the state."Trump is so important to us because he's doing all the things that we tried forso long to do," Proko said."The whole movement is excited about it."That excitement could spark a rise in anti-immigrant action.Robin Hvidston, executive director of Claremont-based We the People Rising, saidTrump's rise has revived activism among those who would expel undocumentedimmigrants.Hvidston said both We The People Rising and another group she works with, TheRemembrance Project, a Texas nonprofit that "advocates for families whose lovedones were killed by illegal aliens," have seen an uptick in membership in thepast year, as Trump campaigned nationally.CAMPAIGN PROMISESThe next step is action, probably on both sides of the debate.Hvidston said her organizations and others will focus on making sure Trumpfollows through on his promises to ramp up deportations and crack down onsecurity along the U.S.-Mexico border.She was encouraged by the president-elect's statements on "60 Minutes" on Nov.13, in which he said his administration would prioritize deportations ofimmigrants with criminal records. He estimated that 2 million to 3 millionpeople fall under that category.But that goal could be tough to achieve. The Obama administration deported 2.5million immigrants over eight years, and reduced the overall number ofundocumented immigrants in the United States. What's more, Trump described the 3million people he wants out as "criminals."Studies suggest about 300,000 of the estimated 11.5 million people living in theUnited States illegally have felony records, a lower ratio than Americancitizens.Still, Hvidston says anti-illegal immigrant activists are already planning whatshe called a "citizen lobbying push" designed to bombard Trump and members ofCongress with phone calls, emails and social media posts calling for action onthe immigration issue."Once he takes office, we will definitely be observing, watching to see if hefollows through," she said.Leo Chavez, a professor of anthropology at UC Irvine who has studiedanti-illegal immigration and anti-Latino movements, said it's natural foractivists to feel emboldened by Trump's popularity.But he questioned how much headway the movement would be able to make in a statelike California, where elected officials have resisted the federal government onimmigration before and seem poised to do it again under Trump."California is the first in lots of things," Chavez said."We were first to push the anti-immigrant rhetoric that we're now seeing inother states like Arizona and Texas, and parts of the South. Now it seems likewe're going to be the trendsetters in the resistance to mass deportations."AWAKESitting in the Laguna Niguel Starbucks where Gilchrist spends most mornings, itis hard to imagine that the 67-year-old retiree in a Richard-Nixon-meets-ElvisT-shirt once commanded a band of citizen border vigilantes.Gilchrist readily admits his group is in "hibernation," damaged by years ofinfighting and by accusations of zealotry and racism by the Minuteman Project'sdetractors.Now, Gilchrist said, he is ready to cede the issue of border security back tothe government, under incoming President Trump."I've done what I set out to do," Gilchrist said."Now, I think the movement can probably stand down to see what thepresident-elect will do."
