Foundation headed by Trump Cabinet pick helped launch The 74Former network TV anchor Campbell Brown has always said she wanted hereducation-news site, The 74, to be perceived as a nonpartisan source forimproving the nation's primary- and secondary-school education.But Donald Trump may have just dumped a major conflict of interest right intoBrown's, and The 74's, lap.By naming billionaire philanthropist Betsy DeVos as his pick for secretary ofeducation on Wednesday, Trump put Brown in the awkward position of covering oneof her closest allies.A foundation headed by DeVos was among the wealthy education-restructuringadvocates that funded Brown's website when it launched last year. DeVos andBrown - formerly an NBC News anchor and the host of a prime-time show on CNN -are also on the board of the American Federation for Children, which promotescharter-school and government-funded vouchers to subsidize private education.The AFC and The 74 co-sponsored a forum involving Republican presidentialcandidates last year.All of which means The 74 would be covering the policy pronouncements andinitiatives of one of the people to which it owes its existence.News organizations sometimes wrestle with subjects and people that are close totheir own interests. The Washington Post, for example, is owned by Amazon.comfounder Jeffrey P. Bezos, whose company and activities are occasionally thesubject of Post stories and editorials. In such cases, the connection betweenthe paper and its owner is disclosed within the article.But in DeVos's case, The 74's interests are more direct, overlapping andconstant. As a site seeking to lead "an honest, fact-based conversation" free of"misinformation and political spin" about the United States' under-18population, its coverage of DeVos and her advocacy of school vouchers andcharter schools will be inherent in almost everything it publishes.DeVos's appointment appears to place the site, which is named for the 74 millionschool-age children in the United States, in much the same position asBreitbart, the digital conservative-news operation. Breitbart's executivechairman, Stephen K. Bannon, has been named Trump's chief White Housestrategist.Brown referred questions about her operation to a spokesman, Dan Bank, who saidthe site discloses its funding relationships in a note published with stories inwhich the relationships are relevant.A recent analysis by 74 writer Matt Barnum included this note: "The Dick & BetsyDeVos Family Foundation provides funding to The 74, and the site'sEditor-in-Chief, Campbell Brown, sits on the American Federation for Children'sboard of directors, which is chaired by Betsy DeVos. Brown played no part in theediting of this article. The American Federation for Children also sponsored The74's 2015 New Hampshire education summit."That's not enough, say those who oppose DeVos and the education-restructuringagenda."Given the fact that Betsy DeVos is a funder of The 74, it is hard to see howthe publication can cover her appointment fairly," said education historianDiane Ravitch, who has clashed with Brown and DeVos on policy matters before. Inview of the close "personal and financial ties" between DeVos and Brown, Ravitchsaid, the site "should not cover the U.S. Department of Education for the nextfour years."Brown has previously recused herself from making editorial decisions for hersite about the AFC and the Success Academy charter-school network because shesits on the board of both organizations.Bank said, however, that Brown will not need to recuse herself from coverage ofDeVos, because DeVos will step down from the AFC and her family foundation willno longer be funding The 74 if she is confirmed as education secretary.Since leaving CNN in 2010 as the host of a program originally titled "No Bias,No Bull," Brown has been one of the most visible faces of a movement that seeksto challenge teachers unions while advocating for the further privatization ofpublic education. Many of her stated positions align with those of DeVos, whohas been a longtime advocate for shifting public funds from public schools tocharters operated by private entrepreneurs and for taxpayer-funded vouchers thatsubsidize the cost of private schools.In late 2013, Brown founded the Partnership for Educational Justice, a nonprofitgroup that seeks to overturn teacher-tenure laws that give underperformingteachers due process in dismissal actions. She has also been outspoken in favorof charter schools.Upon launching her website last year, Brown acknowledged that her site wouldstraddle the line between journalism and advocacy "for a public school systemthat truly serves the 74 million children in this country."She wrote at the time: "I have learned that not every story has two sides. And Iwill not allow for false equivalency when a child's future is being compromised,regardless of the vitriol it provokes."paul.farhi@washpost.com
