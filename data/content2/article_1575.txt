http://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/GUEST_hubbard_112516_newscom.jpgThis month marks 10 years since the death of Milton Friedman, the famousfree-market economist who became one of the 20th century's greatest economists.Since his death, the world has witnessed the worst recession since the GreatDepression along with a massive expansion of federal regulations on commerce,government spending and taxation under President Obama.This period of time has also marked one of the weakest economic recoveriesmeasured by GDP growth, something Milton Friedman would argue is no coincidence.Real GDP growth has stalled between 1% and 2% in recent years, below itspostwar, pre-crisis trend of 3%. Not to mention that wage growth among thepoorest Americans has remained stagnant and labor force participation remainsclose to all-time lows among prime working age individuals.As President-elect Trump and a stronger Republican majority will take office inJanuary, they are presented with a substantial opportunity to carry on MiltonFriedman's free-market, pro-growth legacy in designing what American economicpolicy will look like over the coming years.First, helping "the forgotten man and woman," a chief message in the 2016Trump-Pence presidential campaign, can best be accomplished by promoting fastereconomic growth. Doing so requires putting tax reform first, including expandingthe earned income tax credit and lowering the corporate tax rate.Some unfounded ideas about economic policy arose during the recent electioncycle, such as doubting the net benefits of free trade and blaming the 2003 taxcuts enacted under President George W. Bush for the 2008-2009 Great Recession.We hope that as political rhetoric settles after the election, policymakers canturn to the more rigorous data-driven policy analysis that was championed byFriedman.While we would discourage the use of tariffs or renegotiating trade agreements,which could send consumer prices skyrocketing (and which woulddisproportionately hurt the poorest Americans), there can and should be a rolefor tax credits, wage subsidies and retraining programs targeted at those whohave had their jobs displaced by globalization or automation.Milton Friedman was not opposed to ideas like wage subsidies, which resemble the"negative income tax" he endorsed in his best-selling 1962 book "Capitalism andFreedom."An expansion of the earned-income tax credit (EITC), a form of wage subsidy,could dramatically assist those who have taken low-paying jobs, after beingdisplaced by the phenomena of globalization and automation, in addition tohelping strengthen labor-force participationSimilarly, lowering the corporate tax rate from 35%, currently the highest rateamong OECD countries, is arguably the biggest economic policy opportunity tofoster job creation, particularly among low-wage workers. Such an action couldhelp stem the tide of tax inversions whereby companies reincorporate abroadthrough acquisition --  taking jobs and tax dollars with them.Furthermore, the gains from lowering tax rates for small businesses andsimplifying the regulatory costs of entrepreneurship could reinvigorate thesmall business economy which comprises the largest number of American jobs.Second, there is ample opportunity to spur labor market activity and efficiencythrough reforming the regulatory state.One instance is the ability to overhaul the new Obama mandatory overtime rulesthat will raise the salary threshold from $23,600 to about $47,476 to qualifyfor overtime pay, which, if still implemented, could have a distortionary impacton businesses, incentivizing employers to reduce hours and reclassify salariedworkers to hourly workers.Moreover, the Obama White House further estimates that 81.8% of workers affectedby expanding the mandatory overtime threshold to $47,476 would have somecollege, a bachelor's degree or some advanced degree.Such an initiative is welfare for wealthier educated individuals, who couldbetter be assisted through middle class individual tax relief which does notinterfere directly with businesses.Reforming occupational licensing, a topic to which Milton Friedman dedicated anentire chapter in "Capitalism and Freedom," could help improve the labor marketefficiency of thousands of jobs, from those spending unnecessary hours trainingto be hair stylists to nurse practitioners who are outlawed from doing routinelow-risk procedures in primary care.Easily the greatest example of relaxed occupational licensing laws is the growthof Uber, Lyft and other ride-sharing companies, which have rapidly grown andcreated thousands of jobs and billions in consumer surplus following therelaxation of taxicab licensing laws.Finally, a long-run pro-growth agenda could be fostered by the newfound abilityfor Republican policymakers to temper government spending through reforming theAffordable Care Act and other entitlement spending.There are huge opportunities to restore fiscal balance by increasing theretirement age, reducing Social Security benefit growth for nonpoor individuals,transforming Medicare into premium support, and reducing the burden of thehealth care law on businesses, such as relaxing the ObamaCare employer mandateswhich encourage reductions in labor hours.Education reform that improves the efficiency of our public investments ineducation is another fix that could help promote long-run economic growth. Theidea that educational attainment could be improved through a voucher system waschampioned by Friedman throughout his lifetime and has been embodied in thecontinued work of the Friedman Foundation for Educational Choice, which Friedmanand his wife, Rose Friedman, co-founded in 1996.Thanks to their work, voucher systems have successfully been implemented inFlorida, Mississippi and Tennessee, with strong positive results.In the wake of the recession and the absence of Friedman's intellectualpresence, there have been several new trends in economic thinking that havestrayed from the rigorous level of policy that Friedman applied in analyzing theeconomy and policy prescriptions.We hope that President-elect Trump, his economic team and the RepublicanCongress look to the ideas of Milton Friedman and his intellectual descendantswho have applied such rigor in their thinking. We believe that could very wellbe the best path to "make America grow again" and promote inclusive economicgrowth.     ·    Hartley is an economics contributor for Forbes and a co-founder of          Real Time Macroeconomics.     ·    Hubbard, dean of Columbia Business School, was chairman of the Council          of Economic Advisers under President George W.
