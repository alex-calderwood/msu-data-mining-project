PRESIDENT-ELECT Donald Trump is reportedly considering naming Sarah Palin hissecretary of veterans affairs."My God," tweeted Brandon Friedman, who served as an Army infantry officer inAfghanistan and Iraq, with a link to the ABC News report Wednesday.A spokeswoman for Trump's transition team did not respond to questions aboutPalin, but the former Alaska governor posted a cryptic message about veterans toher Facebook page shortly after the ABC report was published."We should be grateful we'll soon have a commander-in-chief who will championour vets and honor the promises our nation made; a pro-private sector individualwho surely understands bigger government is NOT the answer; a President whopromised to drain the swamp and clean up all government corruption . . . allthings our vets and active duty troops deserve," Palin wrote.Palin endorsed Trump early in the presidential race and campaigned for the mogul- an effort Trump has said he would like to reward.The former GOP Vice-Presidential nominee does have ties to the military.Her son Track spent a year deployed in Iraq with the U.S. Army, and Palininfamously blamed his PTSD on President Obama, saying the commander-in-chiefdoesn't do enough to support struggling veterans. Track Palin was busted fordrunken domestic abuse the same day his mom endorsed Trump in January.News of her prospective appointment didn't go over well with several veterans.Peter Kauffmann, who served as an intelligence officer in the Navy from 2002 to2007, called the floating of her name "the ultimate confirmation that the onlything Trump cares about veterans is using them as props."Friedman, who is now the CEO of public relations firm McPherson Square Group,tweeted "One would be hard-pressed to come up with a better way to showdisrespect of veterans than with this choice."
