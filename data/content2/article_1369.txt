Nearly three weeks into his presidential transition, Donald Trump has hewnclosely to the habits that won him the presidency.He continues to brush aside fine points of policy and freely contradict earlierpositions, with some of the shifts seemingly based simply on the latest advicehe's received or the most recent audience he's spoken to.He has been drawn to those with whom he shares a personal affinity, preparing aCabinet that from early indications leans in the direction of tough-talkers andbillionaire political outsiders like himself.And he has turned a deaf ear to concerns about his ethics and temperament:mixing business ambitions with his pending government power in unprecedentedfashion and unleashing decidedly non-presidential commentary via his favoritesocial media platform, Twitter.On Sunday, angry that Green Party candidate Jill Stein had proposed recounts inthree states in which the election results were close, Trump tweeted anexaggeration of the size of his electoral college victory.Then he falsely asserted that he would have won the popular vote "if you deductthe millions of people who voted illegally."Later, and again without evidence, he tweeted that "serious voter fraud" hadoccurred in California, New Hampshire and Virginia -- all states that HillaryClinton won.Trump's claim of illegal voting, a serious charge which, if true, wouldundermine the legitimacy of the election he won, contradicts extensive analysesthat have shown consistent voting patterns from one state to the next and nosign of serious anomalies. But it repeats a theory widely believed among hissupporters.In reality, state-by-state tabulations have shown Clinton with a popular votelead of 2.2 million votes nationwide that will probably expand to about 2.5million once all the remaining ballots are counted. California, where Clintonwon by nearly 2 to 1, has the largest share of ballots still to count.The Oval Office exerts tremendous gravitational pull on its occupants. PresidentObama, in a fingers-crossed wish, has already predicted that the tug of theoffice eventually will move Trump into a more conventional orbit.Not so far. Indeed, if anything, the transition has been a rerun of the campaignthat preceded it -- more publicly riotous than most with Donald Trump as itscentering force.Such tactics served Trump well in the 17 months since he declared his candidacyfor president. Their persistence in the transition resurrects a question askedrepeatedly since then: Are these growing pains, or the way it's going to be?Some answers may come with the appointments of the most influential Cabinetposts -- State, Treasury and Defense -- which can be defining positions.For now, the rancor is public, with one of those jobs being a key point ofcontention. Fresh evidence came Sunday on network news shows when KellyanneConway, Trump's campaign manager and advisor, excoriated Mitt Romney, who isunder consideration for secretary of State.Romney visited Trump last weekend at his New Jersey golf club in what was thefirst visible rapprochement after Romney scalded Trump's fitness for the WhiteHouse earlier this year.Some leading Republicans have said a Romney appointment would heal divisions inthe party. On CNN's "State of the Union," Conway, by contrast, said that shefelt "compelled" to say publicly that she had seen and heard opposition toRomney's selection that was "breathtaking in scope and intensity.""The number of people who feel betrayed to think that a Gov. Romney would getthe most prominent Cabinet post after he went so far out of his way to hurtDonald Trump," she said. "He gave speeches against Donald Trump. He attacked hischaracter.""I'm all for party unity," she added, "but I'm not sure that we have to pay forthat with the secretary of State position."Conway also cast doubt on Romney's experience."In the last four years, I mean has he been around the globe doing something onbehalf of the United States of which we're unaware?" she asked.Her comments followed criticism of Romney by two other Trump surrogates, formerHouse Speaker Newt Gingrich and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee.That sort of public dispute -- whether it was an effort to influence thepresident-elect or a signal of his intentions -- was one of several Trumphallmarks prominently on view in recent days.On policy, Trump repeatedly has softened or de-emphasized key components of hiscampaign pitch. A video released 13 days after the election did not mentionthree of the biggest applause generators at his campaign rallies -- his promisesto build a wall on the border with Mexico, to tear up the NAFTA trade agreementand to repeal Obamacare.In interviews, he backpedaled on another vow -- his threat to appoint a specialprosecutor to seek to imprison Clinton.Sunday brought another item of policy uncertainty -- his posture toward Cuba.After Cuban dictator Fidel Castro's death was announced, Trump's personalresponse was a tweet that said simply, "Fidel Castro is dead!"Later, his campaign put out a statement saying the Trump administration would"do all it can" to help Cubans achieve prosperity and liberty. But it did notmention reversing Obama's actions that had expanded ties with Cuba, as Trump hadpledged to do during the campaign."Nothing is definite. He'll be speaking with his advisors," Conway said duringan interview on NBC's "Meet the Press" when asked about Trump's plans for Cuba.Trump's incoming chief of staff, Republican National Committee Chairman ReincePriebus, sent a very different message in an interview on "Fox News Sunday.""President-elect Trump is going to be looking for some movement in the rightdirection in order to have any sort of deal with Cuba," he said.As he seeks to fill in his senior staff, meantime, Trump has seemed untroubledby a looming issue for him: how, or whether, to separate his business activitiesfrom his presidency.Early in the campaign, he said he would turn over his company to a blind trust,then said he'd turn it over to his children, who already serve in executiveroles in the real estate firm.But in an interview Tuesday with the New York Times, Trump pointed out thatpresidents are exempt from conflict-of-interest statutes and said that it wouldbe impractical to sell off his business empire, which ethics experts from bothparties have said is the only way to avoid conflicts.In the interview, Trump also admitted that he already had mixed business andpolitical talk in some discussions with foreign leaders.Those moves are reminiscent of his campaign decision to flout decades oftradition by refusing to release his income tax returns or details about loanshe's received.In part due to that decision, Americans have no firm notion of the full range ofconflicts that could present themselves during his presidency.A New York Times survey published Sunday found that Trump's businesses areoperating in at least 20 countries; in many of them, any significant real estateproject requires extensive involvement by government officials. They may nowhave motive and opportunity to try to give favors to -- or solicit them from --the Trump family.With less than eight weeks to go before he takes office, Trump's plans, if any,for addressing that issue may be the transition's chief unanswered question.On "Meet the Press," Conway backed away from any suggestion that the Trumpsmight now distance themselves from their sprawling businesses."Why deny his adult children the ability to do what they do so brilliantlyalready?" she asked.She noted that Trump was talking to "ethics compliance folks" to figure out astrategy."Everything will be done the way it needs to be done," she said.Then she uttered a line that defined Trump's 20 days as president-elect, andperhaps the weeks and months to come: "There's no question that we're inunprecedented times."--cathleen.decker@latimes.com
