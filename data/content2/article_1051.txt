Mayor de Blasio wants to become America's leading leftist voice by using theTrump administration as a foil, but the effort could hurt his bid to return toCity Hall next year.Hizzoner sent a fund-raising e-mail to supporters Sunday promising to "stand up"to attempts to deport people or take away their health insurance and wrote in adefiant Facebook post Wednesday that "the federal government can't tell us howto police our streets."Hours later he met with President-elect Trump and afterward held a pressconference in which he said New Yorkers are "fearful" of a Trump presidency."He got an hour with Trump and told him, 'Don't do this,' and I think all thishelps his re-election and takes the thunder out of opponents," one consultantclose to the mayor said. "He's smart about looking like he's going to seizeanti-Trump sentiment."On Friday, de Blasio compared himself to Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and vowedto "draw a line in the sand" whenever he disagreed with Trump's policies."Anything we see as divisive, anything we see as bigotry, undermining core,American, constitutional values, we have to fight intensely," de Blasio toldWNYC's Brian Lehrer.Some think de Blasio may lose local voters as he tries to ascend a nationalstage."He may have these aspirations, but there's not much record to suggest he willbe successful in becoming a darling of the progressive movement on par withBernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren," said Democratic consultant Dan Gerstein.His brushes with national politics didn't go smoothly during the presidentialcampaign, when the mayor refused to endorse Hillary Clinton for months eventhough he worked on her 2000 Senate campaign. He was ridiculed by the Clintoncamp in leaked e-mails, and relegated to a minor role in the presidentialcampaign.Some confidants say the mayor should focus on making the city great again andleave national politicking to others."He's best served showing what he has done and can continue to do goingforward," said ally Sid Davidoff. "I don't necessarily think being a nationalfigure is what helps in terms of a mayoral campaign."Yet some campaign gurus believe Trump's surprise win gives de Blasio a platformto reach a broader audience of New Yorkers while scaring off challengers."The mayor has an enormous opportunity to stand up on behalf of New Yorkers andour values. Lots of New Yorkers are afraid of Trump and the mayor can be theirvoice," said political consultant Howard Wolfson, who advised Mayor Bloombergand served on Hillary Clinton's 2008 campaign team.
