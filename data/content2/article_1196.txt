HIGHLIGHT: The plan comes at a time when the bloc is seeking to rely less on thesecurity guarantees of the United States.BRUSSELS - European Union officials announced plans for a big increase inmilitary spending on Wednesday, pledging to take greater responsibility fortheir security at a time when the United States appears to be taking a step backin its role in the world.The bloc's top officials proposed spending 5.5 billion euros, or $5.8 billion, ayear to help governments acquire hardware, including helicopters and drones, andto develop military technology.Wary of concerns about consolidation of power in Brussels as member governmentsare under pressure from populist forces, officials stressed that the plan was inno way a step toward creating a European Union army. Member countries would ownthe hardware that was purchased, and much of the money would go to Europeancompanies.But the proposal, known as the European Defense Action Plan, follows calls byDonald J. Trump, the United States president-elect, for members of NATO todevote 2 percent of their gross domestic product to military spending. (Of the28 nations in the European Union, 22 are also part of NATO.)"If Europe does not take care of its own security, nobody else will do it forus," said Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, theexecutive arm of the European Union. "A strong, competitive and innovativedefense industrial base is what will give us strategic autonomy."Total military spending by European Union governments was about (EURO)200billion last year, but the union does not currently have a budget for militaryresearch or procurement. The plan foresees a pilot phase of (EURO)90 million, or$95 million, up to 2020 - and (EURO)500 million, or $528 million, a year afterthat - for research into technologies like drones and for cybersecurity tools.A second plank of the plan foresees spending 10 times that amount to helpgovernments develop and buy hardware. But rather than drawing on the sharedEuropean Union budget, member states would make individual contributions, andsome of the money might come from project-related bonds.Obama administration officials welcomed the increased spending. "It is no secretthat we've been asking them to do this for years," said one senioradministration official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discussalliance relations. But the official also said it was imperative that Mr. Trumpreassured allies that his administration's commitment to collective defense ofNATO allies would be solid.During his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump questioned whether the United Stateswould automatically defend NATO allies if they were attacked, and said Americansupport would depend on the willingness of those countries to pay their fairshare for military protection. But since then, a number of Republican lawmakersand foreign policy experts - including those in close contact with Mr. Trumpsince he won the election - have insisted that the American commitment to NATOwill remain strong.European Union leaders will discuss the proposal at a summit meeting inDecember. The member governments still must approve it, and that could be alengthy process given concerns about sovereignty.Politicians in countries like Lithuania and Poland, for example, might questionwhether the additional spending might be better devoted to bolstering NATO as aresurgent Russia is raising alarms in much of Central and Eastern Europe.Britain could be an obstacle, too. It has long stood in the way of deeperEuropean military cooperation, which London fears could undermine NATO. Britishvoters decided in a June referendum to leave the European Union, but the lengthyprocess of exiting the bloc has not yet legally begun.European officials "know that it will not be easy" to carry out the plans,Elzbieta Bienkowska, the European Union commissioner for the internal market andindustry, said on Wednesday. Federica Mogherini, the union's foreign policychief, said the plans did not amount to competition with NATO.Agreeing to the spending could help European countries get over a "Trump hump"created by the president-elect's demands, said Nick Witney, a senior policyfellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations."This spending is very NATO-compatible, and even money from the European budgetis a fair basis for a country to claim it's chipping more into defense," saidMr. Witney, a former chief executive of the European Defense Agency, a forum forEuropean Union member states to cooperate on defense initiatives."On the other hand, the commitment to spending 2 percent on defense is meant tobe about the long haul, and about genuinely readjusting national budgetpriorities, and I don't see this plan as moving European NATO members muchcloser to that goal," he said, adding that much of the plan was based on debtfinancing.Jyrki Katainen, a vice president of the European Commission, said the timing ofthe plan had "nothing to do with American elections" since it had been in theworks since 2014.A longstanding goal was to avoid duplication of effort in military procurement,which is mostly done on a national basis, and to improve the compatibility ofthe various military hardware that European countries acquire, he said.One example of inefficiency in European defense was the development of theAirbus A400M military aircraft, European officials said. If the proposed plan isadopted, problems that include defining where to place doors for paratroopers -which had contributed to the development of the aircraft taking about a decadelonger than necessary - could be more easily resolved, they said.The officials said more military spending could have a positive effect on thesluggish European economy."Boosting defense R&D in Europe is crucial to maintain critical competences andtechnologies!
