"With our newly unified government, we have the opportunity to leadthe country in a new and better direction."Applegate's spokesman said the candidate raised important issues."We ran a great race and we are really proud of the effort we put together,"campaign manager Robert Dempsey said.Though ballots are still being processed, the current gap between the candidatesappears greater than the number of uncounted votes, shoring up a victory forIssa barring any sort of unexpected development.Orange County Registrar of Voters Neal Kelley said Monday afternoon theyfinished counting all but a small number of damaged ballots and ballots withouta second page. San Diego County officials also said Monday afternoon that fewerthan 1,000 votes were left to count in that portion of the 49th CongressionalDistrict, which spans both counties.The contest was one of the most watched in the country and put Issa, acongressman who built a reputation among Republicans as an unblinking watchdogwhen he led the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, againstApplegate, a retired Marine colonel making his first foray into politics.Heads turned after Applegate, now a trial lawyer, received 45.5% of votes in theJune primary, an unexpected finish that put him within striking distance ofIssa, who received 50.8% .
