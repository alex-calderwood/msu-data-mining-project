On the morning before an annual celebration for the senior class at LoyolaUniversity Maryland, student leaders apologized for this year's theme: "Party inthe USA.""As an organization, we want to extend our deepest apologies to those that werehurt by this theme and the negative impact it had on them," an email from theStudent Government Association to the Class of 2017 read. "Although it was notour intention to create such a divisive climate, we understand that the impactof this decision is much greater than our initial intention."Some students were shocked that a patriotic party could be considered "divisive"and that an administrator had advised student leaders to reconsider it after thepresidential election.Emily Burke, a senior and president of the Loyola Republicans, said that she wasdisappointed: "I was upset to see that that's the standpoint the school wasgoing to take - that they felt they needed to apologize in some way for beingproud to be an American. The theme was supposed to be unifying, and it shouldhave been."It was another sign that in the aftermath of the presidential campaign and theelection of Donald Trump, colleges are particularly unsettled places. In thedays since the election, emotions have been raw at many schools. Anti-Trumpprotests erupted on some campuses.There were ugly incidents targeting minority students at many colleges, withslurs yelled, Muslim students shoved, white-supremacist fliers posted, peopletold to "go back to Mexico."At a few schools, students destroyed American flags in protest.At Loyola University Maryland, several students said, the campus remained calm.The small, private, Jesuit Catholic school is close-knit, said Bradley Schober,a junior who is a leader with the Loyola Republicans. He said people in hisgroup are friends with Loyola Maryland Democrats and that they hang out togetherall the time.Members of the senior class had chosen the "Party in the USA" theme, which isthe title of a pop song, and planned to dress up in patriotic clothes andcelebrate  the United States for the "Senior 200s," which marks the number ofdays left until graduation. In a photo from last year's party, students wearingAmerican flag shirts and bows in their hair posed smiling in front of a model ofthe Statue of Liberty, while someone dressed in Colonial attire was talking withfriends nearby.The student body president and several other members of the Student GovernmentAssociation did not respond to requests for comment; one referred questions to aschool spokesman.The Daily Caller reported that a senior administrator emailed student leadersthat the theme sounded "alienating, divisive and harmful," and another warned itmight give students an opportunity to dress or act in an oppressive way.Nicholas Alexopulos, a university spokesman, said those officials would not beavailable to comment, and he declined to provide the emails that went tostudents. He said in a written statement that the "'Party in the USA' themeencouraged students to dress in ways that celebrate America. Loyola UniversityMaryland supports and seeks events like this one where students celebrate theirLoyola pride and our nation."He said school officials contacted student government leaders and suggestedchanging the timing of the party or altering the theme to ensure it would bewelcoming to everyone in attendance."The SGA made a decision on its own to proactively contact the senior class toacknowledge the concerns of some of their classmates and to ask all members ofthe class to remain committed to respect for one another, open dialogue, andLoyola's other core values as a Jesuit university," Alexopulos said. "LoyolaUniversity Maryland is proud of our students for recognizing that this was anopportunity to strengthen a community where everyone feels welcomed, included,and supported. We continue to work as a university to ensure all studentviewpoints are respected and heard, and we hope students continue to find waysto have constructive dialogue around the most important issues of our time."The email from student government to the campus community read, in part: "Thereare those who see the 'Party in the USA' theme as a way for us to come togetherand celebrate all that the United States has to offer. However, we alsorecognize there are students who do not agree with this theme, given the currentpolitical climate and the rhetoric that still remains even after the election."The email emphasized that the party is meant to be inclusive and concluded byurging students to "come as you are and come together," in costume or not,uphold the school's values and be respectful to all.The executive board of the Loyola Maryland Democrats said the group wouldn'tcomment on the Senior 200s because they had no role in the choice of theme andweren't in contact with the administration or student government about changingit.But they noted: "As a political club on campus, we are acutely aware of the widemix of emotions following the presidential election both on our campus and inour nation. In this moment of tension, our club stands united with students ofall viewpoints and perspectives, races, religions, genders, sexual orientations,and socioeconomic backgrounds. We value upholding and promoting Loyola's values,to focus on the common good of all people despite our individual differences. Wecontinue to support increased public and bipartisan dialogue, and we welcomeinvitations for constructive conversation."On social media, the Loyola Republicans asked for equal treatment from theadministration and faculty: "It should not be acceptable for professors toattack students and call them unintelligent and hateful because of theirpolitical ideology." They wrote that they understand and support politicaldissent, especially in this political climate. "Nevertheless, we cannot support,nor ignore, the comments made about our nation. To call a theme of 'America,'one voted on by the senior class, as 'alienating, divisive and harmful' simplycontradicts the founding principles our nation stands for."Students weren't given the benefit of the doubt, they wrote, and "instead, theadministration rejected an opportunity for us as a school, as a community and asa nation to come together, and immediately assumed the worst of its students."Lindsey Rennie, who graduated from Loyola in 2015, said that she and severaldozen other alumni wrote a letter in support of the administration. She has seencomments on social media from some alumni who felt it was unpatriotic and saidthat they would withhold donations to the school for the time being. But shesaid that she and others feel the administration was staying true to theschool's core values as a Jesuit university, and they were proud of it."This is a school that promotes diversity and inclusion," she said, and "theconcerns of the administration were certainly well founded" given the campusclimate and events happening across the country after the election."We have received a few reports of incidents of bias since the election,"Alexopolus said, noting that he could not confirm or deny anything specific."Loyola takes every report of bias very seriously."The letter to Loyola leaders reads, in part: "Loyola is meant to be a safe spacefor students of all races, genders, sexual orientations, nationalities, andpolitical views. But in the past two weeks alone, we have seen a growing trendacross the country,"  referring to instances of slurs yelled and otherharassment of minorities. "Much of this has been done in the name of America." ... When the administration of Loyola expressed concern to students in SGAabout the theme of the senior event, we did not see it as an act against ourcountry, but rather as an act for, and in solidarity with, Loyola's students.The concern about changing the theme, we believe, was not to prevent people frombeing offended, but to maintain the safety of all Loyola students - physicallyand spiritually," the letter said.Burke said that she is hopeful they can move forward and have open debates withmultiple political viewpoints represented. "I think that's what the school haswanted," she said.The party went on as scheduled. Some students wore red, white and blue. Somewore Trump gear, and some wore Hillary Clinton gear. And, Burke said, "Everybodyhad a good time."susan.svrluga@washpost.com
