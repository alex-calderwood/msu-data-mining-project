Every four years, the Institute of Politics at Harvard's Kennedy School ofGovernment assembles the managers of the presidential campaigns for a deep,post-election debrief. It is always illuminating and generally civil, withoccasional fireworks. Because the 2016 election was unlike any other, thisyear's managers conference was also unlike any other.In the immediate aftermath of President-elect Donald Trump's victory over formersecretary of state Hillary Clinton, all the leading players said the rightthings. Trump called for healing and said that he would try to bring the countrytogether. Clinton asked her supporters to give the newly elected president thespace and opportunity to govern. President Obama, despite harsh words for Trumpthrough the campaign, said that he would assure an orderly transfer of power inthe spirit of reconciliation.But everyone knew or should have known that the wounds from an election that wasas raw and divisive and negative as campaign 2016 would not be quickly healed.That especially includes those who were the principal antagonists, the peoplewho ran the campaigns during the general election. At Harvard's IOP, it allgushed forth, creating perhaps the most contentious session that this series ofconferences, which began in 1972, had ever seen.The general-election session was the culmination of the two-day conference,which was organized in collaboration with Harvard's Shorenstein Center on Media,Politics and Public Policy. Earlier sessions plumbed, separately, the Republicanand Democratic nomination battles, as well as initial strategic assumptions ofthe many major-party candidates who sought the White House this year.On Thursday night, the dinner included a lively conversation among mediaexecutives, punctuated by dissenting interjections from the audience, about therole of the news media, a topic that will be a continuing focus of debate as thenew Trump administration takes and exercises power. Overall the sessions weretame, until the final Thursday afternoon, when the pent-up fury of the campaignfinally erupted.My colleagues Karen Tumulty and Philip Rucker provided a full account of whattranspired when the leading advisers for Trump and Clinton sat across the tablefrom one another for 2                1/2              hours to offer ahistorical rough draft of how the general election campaign unfolded. Theheadline on their story described it as a "shouting match." (For the sake offull disclosure, I helped to moderate the general-election session, along withNBC's Andrea Mitchell and BuzzFeed's Katherine Miller.)What captured the biggest headline was an explosive exchange between Clintoncommunications director Jennifer Palmieri and Trump campaign manager KellyanneConway over whether the Trump team had run a campaign that had empowered thevoices of white nationalists. Palmieri bluntly said Trump had done so and thatshe would rather have lost the election than run a campaign the way she assertedTrump did. Conway angrily stood her ground, denying the charge and contendingthat Clinton lost through her own inadequacies, as she and Palmieri spoke overand past each other.The combination of pain and resentment toward Trump among Clinton advisers wasnever much below the surface. This was an election that the Democratic nomineeexpected to win in what would have been a history-making event. Her adviserswere confident of that victory until the moment late on the night of theelection when their path to 270 electoral votes had been finally blocked byTrump's breaching of the "blue wall" in the Northern industrial states. Theywere devastated by the loss.Campaign manager Robby Mook's explanation of why Clinton lost focused heavily onthe intervention by FBI Director James B. Comey in the final 10 days. Mook saidComey's twin moves concerning the FBI's probe into Clinton's emails contributedsignificantly to the outcome, noting that late-deciders broke far more forTrump. He also acknowledged shortcomings by the campaign, including a failure toproduce the kind of support among key parts of the Obama coalition - whetheryoung voters, suburban women or African Americans - that the campaign hadestimated she would need to win.What Mook and his colleagues found difficult to acknowledge, in part becausethey were there to shield their candidate from too much blame, was Clinton'sweakness as a candidate and the hostility that she had engendered - fairly orunfairly - over a long period of time that hampered her inability to connectmore effectively with enough voters. That will remain an important, if not fullymeasurable, aspect of what cost her the election - and it was something Trump'steam was determined to assert throughout the discussion.If there was pain and resentment on the Clinton side (along with some expressedrespect for what Trump's team pulled off), there was another emotion thatemanated from Trump's advisers, an expression of grievance born of an apparentfeeling of a lack of respect for what their candidate had done after so manysaid he was destined to lose. The same combativeness that marked the electionwas on display time and again during the discussion from Trump's side of thetable - an anti-establishment sentiment of us-vs.-them that will probablyanimate Trump's presidency.There's no question that the newly elected president scored a great upset anddeserves credit for running a far more shrewd campaign than his criticscontended throughout the election. Some of those who attended the Harvardsessions as observers said afterward that the Trump team demonstrated morecompetence and skill as they discussed what happened than some of thecaricatures of the operation as the contest was unfolding.But Trump's victory, however shocking to those who never anticipated it, was nolandslide, as some of his advisers have claimed. He won 306 electoral collegevotes. While that is better than George W. Bush managed in both of hispresidential campaigns, it is a smaller number than in the victories by Obama,Bill Clinton, George H.W. Bush and Ronald Reagan.Beyond that, Trump now trails in the popular vote by almost 2.6 million votes,or 1.9 percentage points, according to compilations posted by David Wasserman ofthe Cook Political Report. Trump's breakthrough victories in Pennsylvania,Michigan and Wisconsin, which sealed his victory, were each by less than apercentage point and by a combined total of fewer than 80,000 votes.All that became another flash point over whether Trump had won a true mandate.When the Clinton team said no, Trump advisers bristled in response. We won, theysaid. Case closed.As the campaign managers were delivering their analyses Thursday afternoon,Trump was on the road to begin a series of rallies to thank his supporters. Hestarted in Cincinnati, and it was as if the campaign had never ended, with thebuoyant president-elect reveling in his victory.Chants of "lock her up" echoed through the arena when he mentioned Clinton, andhe laced his speech with another attack on the "dishonest" news media. Outsidethe arena, protesters signaled their unwillingness to reconcile.So it should have been no surprise that, in the conference room at HarvardUniversity, the tensions between the two sides were so vividly displayed. Theemotions are testament to the deep divisions that will continue to exist and tothe long and challenging road ahead for the 45th president and for the countryhe will govern.dan.balz@washpost.com
