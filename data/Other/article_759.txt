A Harvard tradition ended up as a shouting match on Thursday night.During a political forum meant to analyze the key moments of the presidentialcampaign at Harvard University's Institute of Politics, a three-hourconversation with top campaign officials from both Donald Trump and HillaryClinton camps was plagued by an impassioned argument between Trump senioradviser Kellyanne Conway and Clinton campaign communications director JenniferPalmieri."If providing a platform for white supremacists makes me a brilliant strategist,a brilliant tactician, I am glad to have lost," Palmieri said after Trump'sdeputy campaign manager David Bossie praised the president-elect's controversialpick for senior adviser and campaign chairman Steve Bannon - who was absent fromthe event - as a "brilliant strategist." She added, "I would rather lose thanwin the way you guys did."Conway then shot back, "Do you think I ran a campaign where white supremacistshad a platform? You're going to look me in the face and tell me that?""It did!" charged Palmieri.Conway then replied, "Do you think you could have just had a decent message forwhite, working-class voters? You think this woman who has nothing in common withanybody?"The heated back-and-forth between the pair continued, with Palmieri saying Trump"needs to show me that white supremacy is not acceptable just steps from theOval Office."The panel was the first of the day and intended to be "a first draft of history,and we are trying to capture what happened here for generations to come."Outside the building, hundreds of students protested against Bannon, the formerhead of Breitbart News and Harvard alumni, and alt-right values.Read more: Ringside With Steve Bannon at Trump Tower as the President-Elect'sStrategist Plots "An Entirely New Political Movement" (Exclusive)Since 1972, Harvard's Kennedy School has held a two-day conference on thepresidential campaign, which is attended by journalists and political observers.Elsewhere during the conference, CNN President Jeff Zucker was heckled by GOPcampaign managers during a Wednesday night dinner at the Charles Hotel.The formal event featured Zucker in conversation with members of the media -Washington Post's Marty Baron, AP's Kathleen Carol, Facebook's Elliot Schrageand moderator Sasha Issenberg - about CNN's coverage of the presidentialcampaign.When he defended the amount of airtime the network gave Trump and his rallies,the GOP campaign managers in the room, according to Politco, grew animated andoffered audible reactions."I have to respectfully push back on the campaign managers who spoke here today,because frankly, respectfully, I think that's bullshit. Donald Trump was on CNNa lot," Zucker said in defense of the network. "That's because we asked him todo interviews and he agreed to do them. We continuously asked the othercandidates to come on and do interviews.""I don't remember getting invited to call in, though," replied Sarah IsgurFlores, Carly Fiorina's deputy campaign manager.Others then echoed her statement, interrupting Zucker."You showed hours upon hours of unfiltered unscripted coverage of Trump, thiswas not about interviews," said Marco Rubio senior advisor Todd Harris.After the argument was opened up to the room, Zucker offered: "I understandemotions continue to run high, but that's the reality. That's not cable news'fault, and that's not CNN's fault."He was also criticized for CNN's decision to hire Trump's former campaignmanager Corey Lewandowski as a contributor for the network.Read more: Top TV Execs Meet With President-Elect Trump in Tower SummitOn Friday, Conway told CBS This Morningthat Palmieri's accusations surroundingthe white-supremacy platform were "completely .""I took that personally, and I know that's not true," Conway said."President-elect Trump has denounced every single element of that awfulmovement.

He doesn't ask for their endorsement."Conway also attempted to clarify her criticism for Trump's potential pick ofMitt Romney as secretary of state, saying the president-elect gave herpermission to talk publicly."There are four people as of yesterday," Conway said of the secretary of statecontenders.
