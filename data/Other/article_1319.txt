President-elect Donald Trump's ambitious plan to raise $1 trillion forinfrastructure is a boondoggle that would line the pockets of wealthy investorswhile not meeting the need for infrastructure repair or improvement in much ofthe country, according to an analysis released Thursday by a progressive thinktank.Trump's plan "shovels money at wealthy investors instead of solving realinfrastructure challenges," according to a white paper from the Center forAmerican Progress.The paper figures to be the first salvo in a lively debate if Trump followsthrough on his promise to make refurbishing the nation's roads, bridges andtransit systems a centerpiece of his administration, coupling it with his vow toput unemployed middle-class Americans back to work."It's really a huge failure because it just doesn't deliver on what the actualneeds are out there," said Kevin DeGood, the report's author. "These reallycomplicated deals for which contracts [with private investors] can be beneficialonly apply to one-half of 1 percent of the need that is out there."Trump's transition team did not respond when forwarded a copy of DeGood's reportfor comment.DeGood is director of infrastructure policy at the center, which was founded andled by John Podesta until he resigned to become chairman of Hillary Clinton'spresidential campaign.The challenge is a simple one: Investors want a return on their money, and veryfew transportation projects provide one. Tolls can be imposed on selected roadsand bridges, but the vast majority of them offer no opportunity to recoupinvestment."That would be a very rude shock to a lot of people who voted for Donald Trumpif they suddenly found that the rural roads in Nebraska or Indiana - theinterstate highway, which they paid for and they're still paying gas taxes - nowthey have to pay a toll on top of that?" said Rep. Peter A. DeFazio (Ore.), theranking Democrat on the House Transportation Committee. "They probably wouldn'tbe happy."The Congressional Budget Office said last year that just 26 private-investmentprojects were completed or underway nationwide.The Trump plan would give private investors an 82 percent tax credit to putmoney into projects. Trump said his plan would lead to up to $1 trillion worthof new projects, but simply lowering the cost of money with tax credits toinvestors is unlikely to unleash a new round of big-ticket projects, becausestates already have access to the municipal bond market.According to Trump, his proposal would play a central role in funding $1trillion in projects without draining taxpayer dollars lost by offering the taxcredit incentives. That's because, he said, the tax revenue would be recouped bytaxing the wages of people put to work on the projects and from taxes paid bycontractors hired to do the work.DeGood's paper says: "The Trump plan calls for spending as much as $137 billionfrom the federal treasury in the form of tax credits to wealthy Wall Streetinvestors. This massive subsidy would lower the cost of equity capital to alevel roughly equivalent to municipal bonds."In an interview as his analysis was released, DeGood said the lack of sufficienttax dollars, not a need for financing, was the cause of the failure to addressinfrastructure needs."If just having access to debt at 3 percent were all that project sponsorsneeded to kick off big projects, then that would have happened already," hesaid. "We're in the lowest cost financing universe that we've been in sinceWorld War II, and yet we don't see explosive growth in construction activitybecause it's a lack of tax revenue, not a lack of access to debt."The second part of the Trump plan involves repatriation, a much-talked aboutidea to lure home $2.5 trillion in cash held overseas by U.S. corporations.Trump has proposed reducing the rate companies would pay to bring the money hometo 10 percent from 35 percent. Those companies then could invest slightly moremoney in infrastructure projects, gain the 82 percent tax credit and effectivelyerase that 10 percent tax.ashley.halsey@washpost.com
