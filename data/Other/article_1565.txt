http://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Baronephoto.jpgWhat is to become of the Democratic Party? The world's oldest political party,which traces its roots to 1792, is in as dire straits as it has ever been.It has lost a presidential election most of its followers expected to win. Itfailed to win a Senate majority, gaining just two seats in a year when it hadnearly a dozen plausible targets. Its minimal gain in the House leaves it withjust about as few House seats as it has controlled since the 1920s. It holdsonly 18 governorships and fully controls, through governorships and legislativemajorities, only five state governments -- giant California, midsize Oregon andsmall Hawaii, Delaware and Rhode Island. The total party strength indexcalculated by Sean Trende and David Byler at RealClearPolitics has them at theirlowest point since 1930.Its congressional leaders are able but getting on in years. House leaders NancyPelosi and Steny Hoyer have held party or elective office since the 1970s andinterned in Sen. Daniel Brewster's office in the 1960s. Senate leader ChuckSchumer was elected to the New York Assembly in 1974, when whip Dick Durbin wasalready a congressional staffer.The Democrats' plight is all the more poignant because up to election night,many of them believed that the future would be forever theirs -- and with somereason.Ruy Teixeira and John Judis' 2002 book, "The Emerging Democratic Majority,"pointed the way, predicting that blacks, Hispanics and single women wouldproduce increasing Democratic margins over time. National Journal's RonaldBrownstein and Democratic pollster Stanley Greenberg, in his 2015 book, "AmericaAscendant," thoughtfully elaborated on this theme.But a vulgarized version of this idea got many Democrats -- apparently includingthe high command of Hillary Clinton's campaign in Brooklyn, New York -- thinkingthat an eternal Democratic majority would be a dead certainty. Between 9 and 10o'clock Eastern time on election night, it became clear that this was, in thetitle of Trende's shrewd analysis, "the god that failed."Now it's beginning to seem possible that Barack Obama's two electoral majoritieswere an exception to the rule. In 2008, when Republican foreign and domesticpolicies seemed in ruins, Obama gave Americans the chance to do something manyhad been longing to do for years: elect a black president, a landmark in ourhistory.But the Obama coalition turned out to be too heavily clustered to be easilyreplicated in an election decided by electoral votes and much too heavilyclustered to make the party competitive in congressional and legislativeelections conducted in equal-population districts.Clinton's campaign blithely assumed that rallying "people of color" andmillennials would produce victory. They didn't figure that Midwesternnon-college-educated whites, who had long voted Democratic as a bloc, wouldn'tbe dazzled by Lady Gaga concerts.The Democrats' initial reflex seems to be to lurch further left. Schumer joinedBernie Sanders in backing Rep. Keith Ellison as Democratic national chairman.Ellison may be articulate and charming, but he's also a Muslim representing aMinneapolis district that went 73% for Obama in 2012. Back in 2007, he said the9/11 attacks were "almost like the Reichstag fire" in that they enabled a leaderto "have authority to do whatever he wanted." That sounds uncomfortably close to9/11 trutherism and equating George W. Bush to Adolf Hitler.It's not likely to win votes for Democrats in Wright County, 40 miles outsideEllison's district, where Hubert Humphrey had a lakefront home and Donald Trumpbeat Hillary Clinton 62-29%. A party with a leftist national chairman andcongressional leaders from Brooklyn and San Francisco is not ideally positionedto appeal to voters where Clinton fell short.Exit polls showing Republican improvement among blacks, Hispanics and Asianssuggest regression to the mean -- with people considered minorities behavingmore like the national average. The results also suggest that when you keeptelling white Americans that they soon will become a minority -- a message thatsometimes sounds like "hurry up and die" -- then many non-college-educated"deplorables" may start acting like members of a self-conscious minority andvote more cohesively against your side.The election results certainly don't guarantee an eternal Trump Republicanmajority. Trump's margin was thin, and it's reversible if events turn out badlyor policies fail. But the results also suggest that the arrival of a leftist"ascendant" Democratic majority is not inevitable, either. The polarizedpartisan patterns familiar for two decades have been shaken up this year -- andnot, so far, to Democrats' advantage.     ·    Barone is a senior political analyst for the Washington Examiner,          resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and longtime          co-author of The Almanac of American Politics.
