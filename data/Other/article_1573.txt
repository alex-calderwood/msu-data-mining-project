What resulted wasn't exactlysurprising -- rude and obnoxious, but not surprising.Pence entered the Richard Rodgers Theatre to both cheers and boos, which isunsurprising for national politicians at public events, especially sportingevents. But during the curtain call, Pence was singled out from the stage.Actor Brandon Victor Dixon, who plays Vice President Aaron Burr, lectured thevice president-elect, saying: "We, sir, we are the diverse America who arealarmed and anxious that your new administration will not protect us -- ourplanet, our children, our parents -- or defend us and uphold our inalienablerights, sir. But we truly hope this show has inspired you to uphold our Americanvalues and work on behalf of all of us."Can anyone imagine Broadway actors singling out a Democrat after a show toproclaim their alarm and anxiety over an election result? That's why you dismissthe absurdity that this "diverse America" of hard-left theater people representsanyone outside of the ZIP code in which they perform.Then it came out that Dixon and other "Hamilton" stars haven't voted in years.So much for the alarm and anxiety they've been feeling about the country. It'syet another reason to reject the pleadings of the elites who cannot conduct eventhe most basic exercise in the democratic process -- voting -- and yet demandtheir voices be respected.Pence knew going in that "Hamilton" has become some kind of a "Rocky HorrorPicture Show" crowd-participation event for Trump-hating liberals who cheerwildly at the musical's lyrics that boast about how much immigrants can do.Pence knew going in that the "Hamilton" folks hosted a fundraiser for HillaryClinton's presidential campaign in July -- touted by "news" media as a "boost ofTony-winning star power" -- with ticket prices ranging from $2,700 to $100,000.So who was reflecting a tolerance of diverse views, and who was ranting inside abubble?The controversy took off when Donald Trump tweeted that Pence was "harassed" inthe lecture and deserves an apology. "Hamilton" fans insisted the lecture waspolite. It wasn't.Then The New York Times lectured from a half-mile away that this protest speechrepresented "American principles like free speech, respect and the ability tochallenge authority in the Trump era." Now that is just hilarious. Lecture orheckle Pence, and you represent free speech. Lecture or heckle President BarackObama, and the Times insists you represent white people's rancid failure toaccept a black president.It's going to be a long four (or eight) years of the usual arrogant liberalmockery from the entertainment elite. On the American Music Awards, 21-year-oldsupermodel Gigi Hadid was hailed by liberal media elites for a bad Melania Trumpimpression in which she repeating the tired Michelle Obama-plagiarism joke.Liberals couldn't imagine that a large chunk of red-state America is tired ofmultimillionaire supermodels and Broadway starts telling them that theyrepresent the common people. Earth to the elites: You don't represent the commonpeople. The election was not just a dismissal of your candidate but a rejectionof your condescension.     ·    Bozell is the president of the Media Research Center.
