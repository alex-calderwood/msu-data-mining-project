Supporters of President-elect Donald Trump are moving aggressively to challengeGreen Party presidential candidate Jill Stein's push for a recount in threestates, filing legal challenges and criticizing the effort as quixotic andill-conceived.Trump and his backers have filed challenges the past two days in Michigan,Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, which were critical to Trump's surprise victory lastmonth because they punctured the "blue wall" of states expected to carryDemocrat Hillary Clinton to victory. Trump narrowly won the trio of states.Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette (R) on Friday tweeted that Stein'srequest was "an expensive &a risky threat" as he announced he had filed anemergency motion with the Michigan Supreme Court to stop it.Stein, who has raised millions of dollars from supporters to help pay for thecostly recount efforts, blasted back in a statement calling Schuette's action "apolitically motivated attempt by Bill Schuette to side with Donald Trump inopposition to a fair and accountable voting system.'' She added that "citizensin Michigan and across the country of every political party have expressed theirconcerns around our voting system and deserve to have their votes counted.''Stein has raised concerns about possible hacking or other anomalies in the votein the three states but has presented no evidence of malfeasance. Electionofficials in all three states have expressed confidence in their results, andvoting rights experts have said the effort is highly unlikely to overturn theresults that sent Trump to the White House.Clinton's campaign has joined Stein's recount effort, though it has said it doesnot expect the outcome of the election to change. The Clinton campaign had nocomment on Friday.In Wisconsin, where Trump defeated Clinton by one percentage point, a recount isunderway. But Great America PAC and Stop Hillary PAC, both pro-Trump groups,said Friday that they had filed a legal challenge a day earlier in federal courtin conjunction with a Wisconsin voter to stop the new count. Stein's team saidFriday that it will fight the challenge."Citizens in Wisconsin and across the country have made it clear that they wanta recount and deserve to see this process through to ensure integrity in thevote," Stein's attorney Matthew D. Brinckerhoff said in a statement.In Pennsylvania, where Stein has acknowledged the path to forcing a recount ismore difficult but has initiated an effort to do so nonetheless, attorneys forTrump filed an objection to Stein's request in state court on Thursday."Even with the heroic efforts by state and local elections officials involved inthe recounts, as well as expeditious review by this Court, Stein's proposedprocess will last weeks, perhaps even months. Either way, her request putsPennsylvania at grave risk of having not certified its Presidential electors byDecember 13, the deadline for doing so," the filing says.On Friday, the focus of the escalating battle was in Michigan, as the Board ofState Canvassers deadlocked 2 to 2 over an objection that attorneys for Trumphad filed Thursday against Stein's recount request. Trump had argued that Steincannot, as the state's fourth-place finisher, claim that she is "aggrieved" bythe way the vote unfolded and that there is not enough time to complete therecount by the Dec. 13 deadline to certify Michigan's election results.Because of the deadlock, the office of Michigan Secretary of State Ruth Johnson(R) said in a tweet that "the recount is expected to commence early next week,barring court action."Schuette then filed his emergency motion with the Michigan Supreme Court. It isunclear whether a hearing has been set. The earliest that a Michigan recountcould start would be next week.jerry.markon@washpost.comsean.sullivan@washpost.comAlice Crites contributed to this report.Ã¯...OE For photos and a video, go to wapo.st/transition1203
