DONALD TRUMP'S prospective homeland security secretary, anti-immigrant activistKris Kobach, walked into his cabinet interview with the President-elect holdinga stack of exposed papers that showed in plain sight his plans for thedepartment.Kobach, an early Trump supporter who helped draft Arizona's infamousanti-illegal-immigration bill known as the "show me your papers law," wasphotographed entering his meeting with a cover sheet in hand. The document aboutthe first 365 days of a Trump administration revealed proposals to track "allaliens from high-risk areas" and "update and reintroduce" the National SecurityEntry-Exit Registration System - a program created after 9/11 that acts as aregistry for certain immigrants.The system, which Kobach helped build as a Justice Department staffer underGeorge W. Bush, required men 16 and older from particular countries to registerin person with the Immigration and Naturalization Service in the U.S. Theprogram was largely suspended in 2011.Kobach's paper also revealed that he wants to add "extreme vetting" measures forimmigrants that Trump has proposed, including questions "regarding support forSharia Law, jihad, equality of men and women and the Constitution."Kobach, according to his pitch to Trump, would also "reduce (the) intake ofSyrian refugees to zero, using authority under the 1980 Refugee Act."Much of the paper is obscured by Kobach's sleeve and hand, but a portion at thebottom makes it apparent that he would propose changes to "voter rolls."News of the document's contents was first reported by the Topeka Capital-Journalin Kansas, where Kobach is secretary of state. The newspaper zoomed in on animage of Kobach entering his meeting with Trump in New Jersey on Sunday.Kobach helped author Arizona's Senate Bill 1070, a law that lets police arrest,without warrants, immigrants they suspected of being "removable."The law's key provisions were struck down by the Supreme Court in 2012.Trump, meanwhile, welcomed another slate of prospective hires to Trump TowerMonday as he moved to fill out his cabinet.The President-elect spent the morning at his Midtown abode with former TexasGov. Rick Perry, said to be a candidate for energy secretary or defensesecretary; Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin, under consideration to be interiorsecretary; longtime adviser and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, and formerSen. Scott Brown (R-Mass.), reportedly under consideration to be veteransaffairs secretary, the mogul's transition team said Monday.Trump also sat down with Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii), the former vicechairwoman of the Democratic National Committee who had been a fervent BernieSanders supporter throughout her party's presidential primary.Gabbard said she and Trump had a "frank and positive conversation" about foreignpolicy, terrorism and the fight against ISIS, and urged Democrats andRepublicans to "come together."Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who spent the weekend huddling with Trumpat his golf course in New Jersey, was not present Monday, but news emerged thathe was under consideration for the director of national intelligence post.Previously, reports indicated he was in the running to be secretary of state.Economist Jeff Eisenach and former Sprint Corp. lobbyist Mark Jamison willoversee hiring and policy for the Federal Communications Commission, Trump said.Both oppose recent telecom regulations and support mega-mergers - suggesting alooser approach to FCC deals. Trump also released a short video praising histalented transition team and detailing the first things he'll do in office.He said he'll kill the Trans-Pacific Partnership deal set up by Obama, removerestrictions on U.S. energy production, opening up shale and a clean coalindustries, probe all abuses of U.S. visa programs and set up a rule that anytime a new regulation of any type is imposed, two old regulations must beremoved.What's on his list?Track all immigrants from high-risk countries.Update and reintroduce National Security Entry-Exit Registration System.Reduce intake of Syrian refugees to zero, using authority under the 1980 RefugeeAct.Unclear proposition about changes to voter rolls.
