tells times he Won't seek probe of rivalSays law 'in theory' lets him run both his firm, nationPresident-elect Donald Trump abruptly abandoned some of his most tendentiouscampaign promises Tuesday, saying he does not plan to prosecute Hillary Clintonfor her use of a private email system or the dealings of her family foundation,has an "open mind" about a climate-change accord from which he vowed to withdrawthe United States and is no longer certain that torturing terrorism suspects isa good idea.The billionaire real estate developer also dismissed any need to disentanglehimself from his financial holdings, despite growing questions about how hisglobal business dealings might affect his decision-making as the nation's chiefexecutive."The law's totally on my side. The president can't have a conflict of interest,"Trump told editors and reporters of the New York Times during an expansive,hour-long question-and-answer session. "In theory, I could run my businessperfectly and then run the country perfectly. There's never been a case likethis."Trump further sought to distance himself from a small, far-right movement knownfor its embrace of racist and anti-Semitic rhetoric that has celebrated Trump'selection."I don't want to energize the group, and I disavow the group," Trump said of thealt-right.The president-elect has a record of making statements that are inconsistent withhis previous ones, which means it is uncertain whether any of the positions heespoused on Tuesday will hold in the days going forward, much less after he isinaugurated.Some of Trump's shifts also have the potential to spark a backlash from his mostardent supporters.In his meeting with the Times, Trump assumed a more cordial, magnanimous posturethan he has in recent days. Over the weekend, he used his Twitter account toattack the comedy of "Saturday Night Live" and the cast of the hit Broadway show"Hamilton." On Monday, he upbraided broadcast news executives and on-airjournalists in an off-the-record session that quickly leaked to other media.His stance on Clinton, the former secretary of state, was a jarring pivot fromthe presidential campaign, during which he called her "Crooked Hillary" andthreatened during one of their debates to put his Democratic opponent in jail.At his rallies and during the Republican convention in Cleveland, Trump'ssupporters would regularly chant, "Lock her up!"But on Tuesday, he said: "I don't want to hurt the Clintons. I really don't. Shewent through a lot and suffered greatly in many different ways."Asked whether that meant he had ruled out appointing a special prosecutor, as hehad said he would, Trump said: "It's just not something that I feel verystrongly about."If Trump were to push or try to block a criminal investigation from the OvalOffice, it would mark an extraordinary break with political and legal protocol,which holds that the attorney general and FBI make decisions on whether toconduct probes and file charges, free of pressure from the president.The president-elect's new position may also have no effect on the plans of othermembers of his party on Capitol Hill. Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), who isfinishing his first term leading the powerful House Oversight and GovernmentReform Committee, has vowed to continue to investigate Clinton's email server.An attorney for Clinton, David Kendall, declined to comment.Trump also shifted position on climate change, saying he believes there is "someconnectivity" between human activity and rising global temperatures.In 2012, he had brushed off that idea as a Chinese hoax, tweeting: "The conceptof global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S.manufacturing non-competitive."Asked whether he plans to withdraw the United States from the 2015 Paris climateaccord, he said he is keeping "an open mind to it." The deal negotiated bynearly 200 countries last year commits them to a global push to reducegreenhouse gases.Trump, however, has repeatedly said the agreement is bad for U.S. businesses. Ina speech in May, he declared that during his first 100 days in office, "we'regoing to cancel the Paris climate agreement and stop all payments of U.S. taxdollars to U.N. global warming programs."Trump signaled another shift on the question of how to treat terrorism suspects.During his presidential campaign, he had said that he would reinstate the use ofwaterboarding and similar interrogation techniques in the questioning ofsuspected terrorists."Don't tell me it doesn't work - torture works," Trump said in February at aretirement community in South Carolina. "Okay, folks? Torture - you know, halfthese guys [say]: 'Torture doesn't work.' Believe me, it works. Okay?"But Tuesday, he suggested he might have changed his mind after interviewing aleading candidate for secretary of defense, retired Marine Corps Gen. James N.Mattis, who headed the U.S. Central Command.Mattis argued that he had never found harsh interrogation techniques "to beuseful," Trump said, adding that the retired general preferred building trustwith "a pack of cigarettes and a couple of beers.""I was very impressed by that answer,'' Trump said.Trump spoke extensively about the implications of an unprecedented situation inwhich a businessman with global holdings will sit in the Oval Office. Thatprospect has prompted criticism that there will be inevitable conflicts ofinterest.His election, Trump acknowledged, has been good for his business, making thename that he emblazons on his properties and markets through his licensingagreements "a hotter brand than it was before."As he plans his presidential transition, Trump remains involved in several ofhis private enterprises.He held a meeting at Trump Tower with three business partners building a Trumpproperty south of Mumbai. His new hotel in Washington, just blocks from theWhite House, last week invited about 100 foreign diplomats to hear a salespitch.It also raised eyebrows when Trump's daughter Ivanka, a vice president at theTrump Organization, attended his meeting last week with the Japanese primeminister.While no statute specifically requires divestment by the president, all of themin modern history have put their assets under independent management, generallythrough a blind trust.The concern is to avoid running afoul - in actuality or appearance - of lawsagainst bribery and other forms of corruption in dealings with corporations,foreign entities and powerful interests.Trump noted that he has turned the management of his businesses over to hischildren, giving him a requisite distance from the operation, but he protested:"If it were up to some people, I would never, ever see my daughter Ivankaagain."But his comments fueled more criticism."Donald Trump campaigned against a culture of self-enrichment in Washington andpledged to 'drain the swamp,' but made clear today that he doesn't think therules apply to him," Democratic National Committee communications director AdamHodge said in a statement. "He fully intends to use the Oval Office to expandhis family's wealth."In disavowing the alt-right movement, Trump also came to the defense of hiscampaign's chief executive, Stephen K. Bannon, whom he intends to bring into theWhite House as his chief strategist.Bannon is on a leave of absence as chairman of the website Breitbart News, aleading voice of the alt-right movement. In a recent interview with the WallStreet Journal, Bannon conceded that the alt-right has "some racial andanti-Semitic overtones," but he insisted he does not hold those views.The president-elect defended Bannon. "If I thought he was a racist or alt-rightor any of the things, the terms we could use, I wouldn't even think about hiringhim," Trump said, adding that such accusations are "very hard on" Bannon,"because it's not him."Trump also suggested that he might make his son-in-law Jared Kushner, anobservant Jew, a special envoy to work on brokering peace in the Middle East.Kushner, a publishing and real estate executive with no background ininternational diplomacy, "would be very good at it," Trump said. "I would loveto be able to be the one that made peace with Israel and the Palestinians."Trump also used the session to air his grievances with the campaign coverage ofthe newspaper, which he frequently refers to as "the failing New York Times."Shortly before the session, he had announced via Twitter that he was cancelingthe meeting, but he then reversed himself.He tempered his criticism with praise, however, and at one point called theTimes "a great great American jewel," according to a tweet by Julie Davis, whocovers the White House for the newspaper.During the session, he also softened his frequent threat to reopen libel lawsand use them more aggressively against news outlets that write critical thingsabout him.His reconsideration, he said, came after he discussed the issue with anassociate who told him, "You know, you might be sued a lot more.' I said, 'Youknow, I hadn't thought of that.'"Shortly after the interview, Trump departed for Palm Beach, Fla., where he plansto take a break from transition planning and spend Thanksgiving at hisMar-a-Lago estate.However, Trump tweeted that he is closing in on another Cabinet selection: Hisonetime presidential rival, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, as secretary ofhousing and urban development.Carson told Fox News: "It certainly is something that has been a long-terminterest of mine and I'll be thinking and praying about it seriously over theholiday."karen.tumulty@washpost.comJerry Markon and Elise Viebeck contributed to this report.
