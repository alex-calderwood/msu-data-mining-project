A12LENGTH: 1217 wordsToward the end of October, Sadiq Khan, the first Muslim mayor of London,addressed an event that commemorated the 80th anniversary of the Battle of CableStreet, a famous street protest in the British capital that saw an alliance oflocal Jewish residents, Irish dockworkers, and other laborers and leftiststhwart a planned fascist march.The clashes at Cable Street, which took place at a time when Nazism was on therise, are remembered as a historic turning point in Britain's fight against thepolitics of division and hate, a powerful moment when people from disparatecommunities defended their city and found strength together."This story of solidarity and social integration has inspired many people overthe last 80 years and should continue to inspire us now," Khan said. "Londontoday is more diverse than ever before and on the whole is a shining example ofhow people from different backgrounds can live side-by-side."But his remarks were delivered under a cloud. In many countries in the West, theagenda of ultranationalists seems to be outpacing those of politicians such asKhan, who represent vast, multicultural cities.The modern-day inheritors of the legacy of 1930s fascism - what the heroes ofCable Street rose up against - are in the ascendancy. In Austria, a presidentialcandidate from a party founded by former Nazis stands on the brink of victory inelections in early December. In France, Marine Le Pen, leader of the NationalFront, a party long associated with neo-fascism, is a key player in presidentialelections next year. In the United States, the roots of Donald Trump's appealstretch back to the 19th-century Know Nothings, but his shocking triumph hasbeen cheered by fringe neo-Nazis as well as the Ku Klux Klan.In Khan's Britain, anti-immigrant sentiment and the campaigning of far-rightpopulist politicians led in part to the country's June vote for a Brexit, orquitting the European Union. The stunning electoral verdict was framed byanalysts as a rejection of cosmopolitan elites."There are people in New York that feel closer to people in London and in Berlinthan they do to people in Kansas and in Colorado," Stephen K. Bannon, theideologue tapped to counsel Trump in the White House, grumbled at a meeting withEuropean conservatives two years ago. "And they have more of this elitementality that they're going to dictate to everybody how the world's going to berun."Trump's campaign harped on the supposed evil of "globalism," rhetoric thathelped win him the support of disaffected rural white voters. The detachedliberals of the big cities were going to get their comeuppance.Watching the U.S. election from afar, Le Pen's chief strategist, FlorianPhilippot, chortled on Twitter: "Their world is crumbling. Ours is just beingbuilt."But "their" world - that of multiculturalism and the metropolis - isn't quitecrumbling. In the United States, a host of mayors from major cities havesignaled their willingness to push back against the proposed policies of thepresident-elect, including Trump's stated intent to round up and deport millionsof undocumented migrants.Bill de Blasio, the mayor of New York, has insisted that municipal authoritieswill refuse to cooperate should the federal government under Trump seek toobtain information on undocumented people listed on city databases."We are not going to sacrifice a half-million people who live among us," deBlasio said. "We're not going to tear families apart. We will do everything weknow how to do to resist that."Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel and Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti  made similarstatements.It's not just on issues of deportations where cities and the Trumpadministration may clash. If a conservative Supreme Court overturns  Roe v. Wade, cities can defend the abortion rights of their residents. And in the face ofpolicy paralysis on a national level, cities are pushing through largerprogressive reforms: Seattle recently approved an ordinance for a $15-an-hourminimum wage, which is more than double the federally mandated figure; localpoliticians, including former New York mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, are leadingthe political fight on climate change even as climate-change skeptics enter theWhite House.No matter the ascension of a certain brand of nationalist politics, the realityin much of the West is that countries are becoming both more urban and morediverse.Cities aren't just bastions of jet-setting Davos men: They are home to thefullest range of a nation's diversity. The politicians at the helms of citiessuch as New York or London have to act on a set of concerns - be it addressingincome inequity, reckoning with housing shortages or defending inclusivesocieties - that echo across borders."Increasingly, nation-states look parochial and backward, and cities areactually cosmopolitan and much more broad in their understanding," BenjaminBarber, one of the premier theorists of the global city and author of "If MayorsRuled the World," told WorldViews.Everywhere, cities are the engines of the economy - worldwide, they contributeabout 80 percent of global gross domestic product. More than 80 percent of theAmerican population lives in urban areas. And the populations in medium-to-largecities overwhelmingly tend to vote against the platforms of right-wingpopulists. Yet because of the nature of federal elections - including theweighted system of the Electoral College - the agenda of cities can getsidelined by right-wing populism."There's a fundamental asymmetry between what cities represent and what they areable to accomplish politically," Barber said.But if reactionary national politics puts the progress of a city at risk, thenthere's the chance we'll see more resistance from mayors. Citing powers alreadyafforded to mayors in the United States, Khan has sought more authority in thewake of the Brexit vote, which he thinks jeopardizes London's economic future.That includes greater control over tax revenue. "London's population is the samesize as Wales and Scotland combined, but we have far less control over how ourcapital is run," Khan said in September.Barber points to the growing clout of a number of forums in which municipalauthorities are coordinating on a global scale. This includes the C40 Group ofcities mobilizing around climate change, chaired by Parisian Mayor Anne Hidalgo,as well as the Global Parliament of Mayors, a body Barber helped found thatseeks to be something similar to a United Nations of cities.Globalization has its crises, but Barber insists that the desire ofultranationalists such as Trump to throw up walls and hide behind borders fliesin the face of the forces shaping an interconnected world."These reactionaries," Barber said, "are the last wave in a series of politicalattempts to pretend that sovereign states still work." The nation-state isn'tabout to disappear, he cautioned. But Barber envisions a future where there willbe a "rebalancing of the relationship" between nations and cities that willenable greater local governance."The right-wing nationalism of the Trumps," Barber said, "will become not somuch toxic obstacles to history, but an increasingly obsolete expression."ishaan.tharoor@washpost.com√Ø...OEExcerpted from washingtonpost.com/news/ worldviews
