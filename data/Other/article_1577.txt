Investor optimism for future U.S. economic growth and higherinflation weighed on fixed-income holdings in November. Here are highlights fromthe portfolios for the month:Postelection RallyNorthCoast held significant positions in iShares Core S&P Mid-Cap ETF (IJH) andiShares Core S&P Small-Cap ETF (IJR) heading into November. Both holdings spikedfollowing the election. "Republican control of the White House and Congress willincrease chances of reverting to previous years of less regulation," saidPatrick Jamin, chief investment officer for NorthCoast. "There are alsoexpectations for looser fiscal policies and increased infrastructure spending."Shares of IJH and IJR rallied 9% and 14% in November and are up 19% and 23% forthe year to date.Jamin says having low international exposure could favor midcap and small-capcompanies. "It is uncertain whether the new administration will pursue morerestrictive international trade policies," he said. "Since midcaps and smallcaps are less reliant on international trade, the uncertainty has had less of animpact on IJH and IJR."NorthCoast saw its iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV) positions hit new highs inNovember. The firm is weighing mixed signals going forward. "Overall, our modelis telling us to be heavily invested in IVV," Jamin said. "We are seeing bullishmacro, technical and sentiment indicators, but bearish valuation indicators."IVV climbed 4% during the month and is up 10% year to date.Jamin and his team are closely monitoring how policy development of the Trumpadministration could impact U.S. companies. "The new president-elect hasn'treally been that explicit about the economic measures he is going to try toimplement," he said. "There has been a strong anti-immigration stance, whichcould be a problem for technology companies which have attracted a lot oftalented foreign workers."Fixed-Income HeadwindsFixed-income ETFs have not experienced the same enthusiasm as equity ETFs sincethe election. In November, iShares 10+ Year Credit Bond ETF (CLY) gave back someof its outsized gains from earlier in the year. "It has pulled back less thanother bonds of similar duration," Jamin said. "Since the decline, it is yielding4.4%, which is a very attractive yield."Shares of CLY fell 5.4% in November, but are up 4.4% for the year.NorthCoast remains overweight CLY, but has lightened up its stake. "Valuationindicators from our models have been strong, but sentiment indicators haveturned negative," Jamin said. "This has led us to trim our position slightly."Jamin is sticking to NorthCoast's position in iShares J.P. Morgan USD EmergingMarkets Bond ETF (EMB) for the time being. The holding also encounteredresistance in November. "We are currently overweight EMB because there is a verystrong yield of about 5%," he said. "Potential appreciation of the U.S. dollarfrom higher interest rates could negatively impact EMB, which is denominated inlocal currency, so that is a risk we are looking at."RELATED:NorthCoast ETF Retirement Portfolios Focus On Earnings And Interest Rates
