Adam McKay is hoping to do for White House politics what The Big Short did forWall Street greed.The director is reteaming with Paramount and Plan B for an untitled film aboutformer vice president Dick Cheney, The Hollywood Reporter has confirmed.The project, penned quietly by McKay, will chart Cheney's jump from his CEOposition at Halliburton to his vp role under George W. Bush. While at the WhiteHouse, Cheney pushed for the post-9/11 war on global terrorism in Afghanistanand Iraq (based on unsubstantiated notions that Saddam Hussein had weapons ofmass destruction and was conferring with al-Qaida), and instituted an "enhancedinterrogation program" that included waterboarding. Before Halliburton, heserved in the administrations of Nixon, Ford and George H.W. Bush. Often likenedto Darth Vader, Cheney is one of the most enigmatic figures in recent politicalmemory.Plan B producers Brad Pitt, Dede Gardner and Jeremy Kleiner will again producewith McKay and his Gary Sanchez partners, Will Ferrell and Kevin Messick. Thescript will go out to actors shortly, as production is eyed to begin in springfor a late 2017 release.Read more: Jeffrey Katzenberg Pens Open Letter to Hollywood After Trump VictoryThe Big Short, McKay's first foray into drama features, earned five AcademyAward nominations, including for best picture and best director, and won theOscar for best screenplay.
