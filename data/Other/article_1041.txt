DONALD TRUMP, after relentlessly bashing the Clinton Foundation during thepresidential campaign, now admits his own namesake charity violated federal taxregulations.The Donald J. Trump Foundation's 2015 tax filings, as reported by thenonprofit-tracking website GuideStar, included an acknowledgment that money fromthe charity was used "for the benefit or use of a disqualified person."Translation: Trump, his relatives or one of his businesses could have improperlyreceived money from the foundation last year.The foundation's 13-page filing, without providing any additional detail,further admitted the same violation had occurred previously.The Trump transition team did not immediately respond to the postings of theInternal Revenue Service documents.The IRS defines a disqualified person as anyone in a position to hold"substantial influence" over a charity - as well as their relatives and theirbusinesses.The fifth page of the paperwork contained the not-so-surprising news, with thefoundation answering yes to the question of whether any income or assets weretransferred to a "disqualified person."On the same page, the foundation acknowledged this was not the first time aroundfor the mishandling of funds. If any wrongdoing is found, the recipient of thefoundation money could be required to reimburse the cash.The Washington Post reported during the presidential campaign that Trump hadtaken some $300,000 in foundation money for his own benefit.In two of those cases, the funds were used to buy portraits of Trump at charityauctions.The IRS forms provided no details on where the money went, how much money wasinvolved and what years other than 2015 were affected.New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman is already investigating theTrump foundation, and has stopped the organization from fund-raising in thestate.The foundation paid the IRS a $2,500 fine earlier this year after cutting a$25,000 check three years ago to a political committee backing Florida AttorneyGeneral Pam Bondi. Foundations aren't allowed to make political donations.Trump later explained that he intended to make the donation from his personalfunds. The donation came while Bondi was considering whether to file a lawsuitagainst the billionaire over his Trump University.Bondi took the money and opted not to pursue Trump - who settled three lawsuitsagainst his controversial "university" last week for $25 million.Fox News legal analyst Bondi, who remains Florida's top prosecutor, met withTrump last week about a possible position in his administration. She's deniedany link between the donation and her decision not to pursue the case.The new documents also showed the foundation's donors included a Ukrainianindustrialist's foundation. The Victor Pinchuk Foundation gave $150,000 to theTrump Foundation in 2015, while Trump was running for President.Similar donations to the Hillary Clinton campaign by Pinchuk raised conflict ofinterest questions for the Democratic hopeful.
