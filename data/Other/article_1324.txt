Annual speech calling for unity, mending U.S. ties is panned as banalMOSCOW - Russian President Vladimir Putin called for better ties with the UnitedStates in his annual address Thursday, while brushing away allegations ofmeddling in the U.S. presidential campaign and Washington's concerns aboutKremlin interference in other countries.But the moment that went viral on Russian websites was an image of the nationalbroadcast that showed his prime minister, Dmitry Medvedev, eyes turned down,appearing to doze off.Whether the premier was napping or just checking his notes, the image was seenby many as an appropriate metaphor for the 70-minute, nationally televisedspeech.In a businesslike tone that recalled a Soviet Communist Party Central Committeemeeting, Putin ticked off various economic issues and raised his emotional level- and his own voice - only when he brought up the Olympics doping scandal and"external pressure" on Russia."They've used everything against us," Putin said. "Myths about Russianaggression, about propaganda, interference in other countries' elections,besmirching our athletes, including Paralympic athletes.""Unlike other foreign colleagues, who see Russia as an enemy, we are not lookingfor and never looked for enemies," Putin added.He repeated his desire to improve Russia's relationship with Washington -another clear signal of Moscow's hopes to build ties with President-elect DonaldTrump - amid Western outcry over Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014, itsproxy war in eastern Ukraine, and its air campaign in support of SyrianPresident Bashar al-Assad."We are ready for cooperation with the new administration," Putin said. "I amcounting on joint efforts with the United States in the fight against real, notimagined, threats of international terrorism."Putin has on several occasions spoken of the need to mend U.S.-Russian tiessince the election of Trump. Trump, for his part, has spoken about the need tocooperate with Russia.For most of the address in the opulent St. George's Hall of the Kremlin, Putinlisted economic data and plans to improve Russia's infrastructure. Governmentofficials and members of parliament applauded mildly here and there."The only emotional parts of the speech concerned international politics;everything else was dreary, full of banalities,"  Stanislav Belkovsky, a liberalRussian political analyst, said on the independent television station TV Rain.Later, he added: "It's clear that Putin's address to the Federal Assembly isnothing more than a ritual at this point. He doesn't treat the content of hisspeech seriously."An example: Putin has slowly worn away democratic institutions such asopposition parties and checks and balances against his own power, but he praisedhis administration's course of "developing democratic institutions andincreasing competition."Opposition parties have been pushed to the sidelines in Russia, and Octoberparliamentary elections returned a supermajority for Putin's United RussiaParty."We've proven that we live in a healthy society that is sure of its justrequirements, where immunity from populism and demagoguery is beingstrengthened, and where the meaning of mutual support, consolidation and unityis valued," Putin said.The Russian leader said unity had helped stave off "coups and in the end,anarchy" - a veiled reference to the "color" revolutions of other post-Sovietstates such as Ukraine, where Russia is fighting a proxy war in the east afterannexing the Crimean Peninsula.Putin also made a reference to the refugee crisis in Europe and the chaoticelection campaign in the United States."It's troubling that in the world, even in the seemingly most well-off countriesand stable regions, there are more schisms and national, religious, politicaland social crises," the Russian leader said."We know well the consequences of such so-called great upheavals," Putin said,noting the 100th anniversary of the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution next year.Pro-establishment politicians and observers praised the speech and Putin's callsfor consolidation."Liberals consider patriots idiots, patriots consider liberals traitors,"tweeted Sergei Markov, a pro-Kremlin political analyst. "Putin called on them tostop quarreling and create a normal society."Others saw it a different way."This address is so boring it's funny," tweeted Belkovsky.Much of Putin's speech touched on specifics of the economy, mired in a two-yearslowdown, and he called for tax law changes, investment in health care andeducation, and improvements in technology."Let us remember that we are a united people, we are one people, we have oneRussia," he said.david.filipov@washpost.comandrew.roth@washpost.com
