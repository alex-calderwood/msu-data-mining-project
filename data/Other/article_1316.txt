Charles Krauthammer's assertion in his Nov. 25 op-ed, "For Democrats, the roadback," that Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton lost the election toRepublican Donald Trump because she relied on a coalition of "African Americans,Hispanics, gays, unmarried women and the young" while Mr. Trump "managed toread, then mobilize the white working class" defies logic and belies reality.After all, Ms. Clinton won the popular vote by more than 2 million votes, whileMr. Trump won the electoral college by slightly more than 100,000 votes.Alfred Munzer , Washington
