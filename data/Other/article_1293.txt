Eric Chenoweth is co-director of the Institute for Democracy in Eastern Europe.In assessing Donald Trump's  presidential victory, Americans continue to lookaway from this election's most alarming story: the successful effort by ahostile foreign power to manipulate public opinion before the vote.U.S. intelligence agencies determined that the Russian government activelyinterfered in our elections. Russian state propaganda gave little doubt thatthis was done to support Republican nominee Trump, who repeatedly praisedVladimir Putin and excused the Russian president's foreign aggression anddomestic repression. Most significantly, U.S. intelligence agencies haveaffirmed that the Russian government directed              the illegal hackingof private email accounts of the Democratic National Committee and prominentindividuals. The emails were then released by WikiLeaks, which has benefitedfinancially from a Russian state propaganda arm, used Russian operatives forsecurity and made clear an intent to harm the candidacy of Hillary Clinton.From the Russian perspective, the success of this operation can hardly beoverstated. News stories on the DNC emails released in July served to disruptthe Democratic National Convention, instigate political infighting and suggestfor some supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) - without any real proof -that the Democratic primary had been "rigged" against their candidate. On Oct.7, WikiLeaks began near daily                            dumps  from Clintoncampaign chairman John Podesta's email account, generating a month of largelynegative reporting on Clinton, her campaign staff, her husband and theirfoundation. With some exceptions, there was little news in the email beyondpolitical gossip and things the media had covered before, now revisited from aseemingly "hidden" viewpoint.Russian (and former communist) propaganda has traditionally worked exactly thisway: The more you "report" something negatively, the more the negative is true.Trump and supportive media outlets adopted the technique and reveled ininformation gained from the illegal Russian hacking (as well as many "fake news"stories that evidence              suggests were generated by Russianintelligence operations) to make exaggerated claims ("Hillary wants to openborders to 600 million people!") or to accuse Clinton of illegality, corruptionand, ironically, treasonous behavior.Part of the Russian operation's success is that we cannot measure the effect.Did the DNC emails depress the Sanders vote for Clinton? Did the Podesta emailsturn off independents? Would voters have responded differently if major mediahad reported the email releases not as legitimate news but as an intelligenceoperation by a hostile foreign power aimed at undermining the integrity of U.S.elections? There are no clear answers. But there are certainties: The emailoperation increased negative stories about Clinton, fueled an immense propagandaattack and diminished coverage of actual issues. The large polling lead Clintongained after the debates slipped significantly under this barrage of negativity- even before FBI Director James B. Comey's  bombshell.Again, was there coordination with this foreign intervention? Russia's deputyforeign minister, Sergei A. Ryabkov, boasted that government representativesmaintained multiple "contacts" during the campaign with Trump's "immediateentourage." (Campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks issued a denial.) This is on top ofreported U.S. government suspicions that a Trump adviser met with theintelligence operative directing the hacking. Where are the committee chairmenin Congress demanding an investigation? How is it that Republican Party leadersaccept the intervention of a foreign power in the election of their party'spresidential candidate?Putin is pursuing large strategic goals: recognition of the annexation of Crimeaand international acceptance of foreign aggression to change state borders;Russian control of all of Ukraine; weakening or even dissolution of the EuropeanUnion and NATO; restoration of Russia as a great power; and restored dominanceover the former Soviet bloc and its environs. In pursuing these aims, Putin isengaged in a disciplined effort to influence democratic politics in the West,including financial and propaganda support for the narrow Brexit victory and fora network of far-right (and pro-Russian) nationalist political parties andgroups throughout Europe. Now he has achieved what had to have been his mostimprobable goal: helping elect a sympathetic U.S. president who wants to form analliance against terrorism. What will Trump give in exchange? He has alreadyreaffirmed his intention to end support for pro-Western rebels in Syria, whicheffectively gives Russia a free hand to make President Bashar al-Assad itssatrap. The greater danger is Trump's attitude toward NATO as a "soft" alliancethat, like the Western powers in 1939, won't "die for Danzig." It would mean thealliance's end.In his book "Putinism," Soviet and Russian historian Walter Laqueur describesthe varied ideological strains that animate the former KGB agent. The "Russiannational idea" that has emerged is to defend Russia, Eurasia and the world fromthe anti- civilizational corruption of Western liberal democracy. Frighteningly,Putin's worldview has resonance in the populist and nationalist fixations ofStephen K. Bannon, the president-elect's senior counselor, whose stated missionis to "destroy" the "establishment" and end the domination of the "donor class."Bannon's "closing argument" ad for Trump, redolent of Russian propaganda,described the United States as a corrupt and failing state because of nefarious"global special interests." It all points to grave danger for democracy and aworld order that has kept the peace for 70 years. Is this what America votedfor?
