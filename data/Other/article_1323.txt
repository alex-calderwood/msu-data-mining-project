Joseph Sakran remembers the day in 1994 when an errant bullet changed thetrajectory of his life.Then a senior at Lake Braddock Secondary School in Burke, Va., he remembers theflash from the gun fired during a fight after a football game, people dispersingand blood gushing over his clothes. He had been shot in the throat.Over the next six months, Sakran had a tracheotomy and multiple operations tohelp him breathe and speak. The 17-year-old also resolved to become a doctor. Hebelieved that his destiny was "to give others that second chance I've beengiven."Now 39 and a trauma surgeon at Johns Hopkins Hospital, Sakran is on theforefront of a movement among medical professionals growing more vocal about asurge in gun violence in Baltimore, a city where more than 240 people have beenfatally shot this year, as well as across the country. His medical advocacygroup is joining forces with another physicians organization, and he hopes tolaunch more in-depth research into shootings and victim outcomes.Sakran says he is motivated by his experience as a survivor and his experienceperforming emergency surgery on gunshot victims. He said he recalls the looks onhis parents' faces two decades ago when talking to the parents of shootingvictims he is trying to save."Their faces are chiseled in my mind," he said. "I imagine what they had beengoing through - and not always does someone survive."In Baltimore, one out of three people shot last year died, making the city oneof the most lethal of America's largest cities, according to a year-longBaltimore Sun investigation. The odds for gunshot victims worsened last year inat least 10 of those cities, including Baltimore, Chicago and Milwaukee, the Sunfound.Although medical advances and practices have dramatically improved the survivalrate of most trauma patients, studies by hospitals including Johns Hopkins haveshown that the chances of gunshot victims surviving have decreased. At the sametime, a number of deadly trends have taken root, including as criminals usinghigher-caliber guns with large-capacity magazines, leaving multiple-gunshotvictims to bleed out more quickly.Political impasses over universal background checks for gun purchasers andincreasing federal funding for research into gun violence was among the reasonsSakran started the group Doctors for Hillary two years ago. The group supportedDemocratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, who made gun control a centraltenet of her campaign. Sakran said his group includes a few hundred core membersand 65,000 followers on Facebook.In the wake of Donald Trump's win over Clinton, Sakran plans to merge his groupwith Doctors for America, a political advocacy group of health professionalsthat pushed for health-care changes and has made increased federal funding forgun violence research a top goal.Sakran hopes to continue pushing for universal background checks, closingloopholes that allow customers at gun shows to bypass background checks,preventing "straw" purchasers from legally buying guns for people with criminalrecords and greater restrictions on "military-style weapons.""More than ever, it's going to be important for us to really take a concertedeffort to say that 'This is not a Democratic issue, not a Republican issue. Thisis an American issue,'" he said.Trump (R) has opposed limits on gun ownership, and any gun-control measure islikely to meet stiff resistance in a Republican-controlled Congress. Trump hassaid he would appoint Supreme Court justices who uphold the constitutional rightto bear arms and would seek to expand mental health treatment programs in thewake of mass shootings by mentally ill people in recent years.Alice Chen, the executive director of Doctors for America and an internalmedicine physician and assistant professor at George Washington University andthe David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, said common ground can be found onsuch issue as preventing suicides and child injuries by firearms."All of us have a responsibility to be more civically engaged," Chen said."Certainly, we have to think about what are the likeliest things that we can getpassed in the new political environment ... But the urgency to do something doesnot change."Sakran said seeking changes on a state-by-state basis may be another route fordoctors to pursue.Although Maryland already has some of the strictest gun laws in the nation,Baltimore Police Commissioner Kevin Davis plans to step up efforts to lobbylawmakers in the General Assembly session that begins in January for mandatoryprison time for people arrested with illegal handguns and high-capacity gunmagazines. Other proposals legislators plan to push include bills to ban gunsfrom college campuses and prevent people on federal terrorist watch lists frombuying them.S. Rob Todd, chief of general surgery at Ben Taub Hospital in Houston and amember of Sakran's group, said surgeons need to continue to make the public andpoliticians aware of the worsening conditions in which many gunshot victimsarrive at hospitals. Todd, who is also a professor at the Baylor College ofMedicine, said the percentage of gunshot victims dying in the emergency room hasincreased significantly since 2000."At some point, we have to stop being quiet and we have to start speaking up,"he said. "We can talk about the gravity of the situation. We can talk about whatwe see."Sakran said he also wants to study the degree to which gun violence has becomemore intense nationally using data from medical examiners' records and theNational Trauma Data Bank.He also wants to study Johns Hopkins patients who have been shot on more thanone occasion to determine the factors that put people at a greater risk of beingvictimized.Sakran has vivid memories of his own shooting. He recalls  turning his headtoward two people who were arguing when someone fired a .38-caliber gun into thecrowd of high-schoolers, striking him and another student, who also survived. Heremembers choking on his blood as paramedics tried to place him flat in amedevac and a trauma surgeon taking charge amid the chaos and wheeling him intoan operating room.Sakran's trachea was ruptured and his left carotid artery, which provides bloodflow to his brain, was severed. One of his vocal cords was paralyzed, as was aphrenic nerve, which helps with speaking and breathing.Sakran underwent multiple operations at Inova Fairfax Hospital, where he wasborn and where he would do his residency years later.In a permanent, slightly hoarse tone with a volume about half of what it shouldbe, Sakran speaks admiringly about the trauma surgeon and vascular surgeon whosaved his life and taught him as a young resident."I was really inspired to give others the opportunity I had been given," hesaid.The bullet that struck Sakran was surgically removed weeks later. He keeps it ina container on his dresser and takes it out to examine every once in a while asa reminder of his near-fatal shooting and his mission to save others.- Baltimore Sun
