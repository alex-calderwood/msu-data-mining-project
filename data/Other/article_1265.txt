C01LENGTH: 1531 wordsThe reports suggesting that people of color had not shown up for HillaryClinton, they nagged at Damon Young.So once the electoral votes were called, Young, the editor in chief - or,perhaps,  provocateur in chief - of the black-culture website Very SmartBrothas, started typing.Not a defense of the black electorate. Instead, Young banged out a midnightscreed, sorrowful but determined to point at where he believed the blame forClinton's loss in the presidential race belonged.He filed his post under the headline, "I Will Never Underestimate White People'sNeed To Preserve Whiteness Again."The name Very Smart Brothas probably doesn't register with readers of mainstreamnewspapers and magazines. In a good month, the site may draw 2 million uniquevisitors. Compare that with BuzzFeed's 71 million.But young African Americans voraciously read and share Young's posts, as well asthose of site co-founder D. Marcellus Wright. Since the 2012 death of TrayvonMartin, amid growing tension over race and the rise of Black Lives Matter, overcries of "reverse racism" and "All Lives Matter," Very Smart Brothas has emergedas a stream-of-consciousness sounding board, an expletive-laden fuse and anabsurdist inside joke.Want to understand "white tears" or why the Texas girl at the center of theSupreme Court's most recent affirmative-action case was chewed up and spat outon Twitter as #BeckyWithTheBadGrades? (Her name, for the record, is  notBecky.)Young and Wright (who writes under the nom de plume Panama Jackson) explain allthis and then some from the black point of view, often under clicky headlinesthat mimic ones you might see on BuzzFeed: "Michelle Obama's Embrace of FecklessWar Criminal George Bush Is the Blackest Thing That Ever Happened Last Week,"and, "How Ryan Lochte Is the Worst Type of 'White Boy Bro,' Explained."Whether their writing is seen as pointed, funny or racist depends on who'sreading. But the Brothas' quick takes on American pop and political culture arerapidly earning intellectual legitimacy.Years before the blog gained any national traction, the Roots' Questlove shoutedout Very Smart Brothas to his sea of plugged-in Twitter followers. Then, NewYork Daily News columnist and activist Shaun King started sharing VSB's posts.Even the New Yorker's Pulitzer Prize-winning TV critic, Emily Nussbaum, hasmentioned them.And this month, the HarperCollins literary imprint Ecco signed Young to atwo-book deal.Young and Wright exhibit a "lack of fear about what they're talking about," saysEcco Executive Editor Denise Oswald."There's no good to be had from a bunch of white people sitting around talkingto each other," she says. "There has to be raw and unmitigated truth, but with asense that we're all welcome to the conversation."This, she says, is how Very Smart Brothas makes readers feel.After appearing at a recent Washington book talk for another prominent blogger,Young finds himself in a corner, facing a line of fans waiting to meet the guyblowing up their Facebook feeds."I'm so excited to meet you," gushes one woman.Young squirms slightly. He makes a peace sign with his fingers and looksstraight at the cellphone waiting to take his photo."You're awesome, too," he says, looking slightly pained.On a laptop, Young comes off as a renegade.IRL - in real life - Young is ... shy.Over dinner at a wine bar after the book talk, Wright and Young, both 37, riffon how they managed to climb out of their Internet niche - "the blackblogosphere," Young says - to become viral stars, recently attracting theattention of readers who aren't black at all. Comment threads on their siteregularly stretch to a thousand entries. After the election, they spiked tonearly 2,000."We get to say things the way people aren't saying them," Young says. "People"being, of course, the mainstream media. "We get to write things that otherpeople can't write."Like "The Wash, Rinse, and Repeat of Being Black in America Today," which Wrightpenned after the September police shooting of Terence Crutcher in Oklahoma."If you comply, you won't end up dead. Yeah. Right," he wrote. "Black bodieshave been killed in every single possible way you can end up dead at the handsof police. Complying. Not complying. Running. Standing. Running away from."Or this from Wright, on the president's candor in his final year in office:"From 2008 to 2015, Barack Obama was the President of the United States. Now,however, he is the Grand Supreme Wizard of Nof---sistan."Young's sense of humor darts in and out of Very Smart Brothas' posts. It definesthe blog's voice. In person, it glimmers only after he has warmed to you.Married and the father of a toddler, Young talks mostly about wishing that hehad more time to write. He was a college basketball player until, he says, herealized that he wasn't actually that good. He focused instead on writing,majoring in English at Canisius College in BuffaloHe's wearing a gray T-shirt, baggy ripped jeans, brown shoes and a rosary aroundhis neck. When his food arrives, he bows his head for a flicker of a second andrecites a prayer.Wright, who has three kids ages 4 months to 7 years, is in many ways Young'sfoil. He lives in Washington and spent 13 years as a congressional staffer, alsoteaching a summer program at the University of Maryland aimed at encouragingminorities to enter politics. His mother is white and from France (his parentsmet serving in the U.S. military, and he was born when they were stationed inPanama, the source of his pen name), a fact that he recently examined as hewondered, in one post, whether she would be voting for Donald Trump. He promotedparties at the U Street nightclub Liv for years and prefers to write about musicrather than race. With his stylishly rolled-up pants and burgundy Conversesneakers, he looks like a hipster. "I would be out 24/7," he says. "My kidsabsolutely slowed me down."They met the way people of the Internet seem to meet: They liked each others'blogs. Even after they started working together, they didn't meet in person foryears.Both gifted in the early language of the Internet - verbose snark thatpresupposed readers, even if there weren't any - they started a relationshipblog. They swapped shifts writing. They posted at midnight, underscoring theirsex-fueled subject matter. Wright says he banged out posts in 15 minutes andrarely read behind himself, something he would never do now. Young did theopposite, reading and rereading, editing for hours, and then even after he hadhit "publish."Young quit his day job teaching to turn the blog into an enterprise, corrallingwriters but also shaping the Very Smart Brothas voice into somethingdistinctive.Filed under the headline "The First Perfunctory Race-Specific Entry," the firstreal post about race came a few months into Very Smart Brothas, in 2008. "This'black man's hat' is heavy as hell," Young wrote. "No wonder I keep it on theshelf."But then. The election of a black president started a conversation, maybe, ifyou believe that, or it unplugged a dam of tension and ill will, if you believethat . And Wright and Young - mostly Young - took the hat off the shelf.Young says he struggles with the competing interests of writing and running asite. He wants to write pieces that provoke, the sort that net him retweets andshares. And, he says, "as editor of a blog, I want traffic." Which is anothersort of affirmation entirely.To attract traffic, mentions of Taylor Swift, Kanye West and Beyonc√© are oldstandbys. The election of Trump has provided a wealth of subject matter and pageviews. So have police shootings."Police shootings are always going to be good for traffic, in a negative way,"Young says. This is how many readers have found Very Smart Brothas, a fact thatneither Wright nor Young seems particularly comfortable with.Both confess some terrible mistakes, including a 2012 post by Young urging womento use common sense to avoid rape. He describes the backlash - he found himselfbeing called a rapist - as one of the worst experiences of his life.After the book talk, he insists that he owes his success to black women, toreaders and friends such as blogger and author Luvvie Ajayi, who could haveturned on them but didn't. Instead, he says, they told him that he was wrong.And he hasn't forgotten it. (The Internet, Wright agrees, also does not forget.)"We have been successful," Wright adds, "in spite of ourselves."Back at the book talk, Wright creeps up from a seat at the back and muses aboutfame. Young "doesn't love this," he murmurs, cocking his chin in the directionof the queue.But there are signs that Young is adjusting. A woman in a wheelchair tells himthat she's a blogger, too, her Africa-shaped earrings swaying as she talks.Young leans down until his eyes are level with hers. Maybe she could shoot apiece his way, he suggests."Send it to -" he starts, about to tick off the blog's general email address.He stops himself. He gives her his personal email instead.Then he takes a breath and gets ready for the next photo.lavanya.ramanathan@washpost.com
