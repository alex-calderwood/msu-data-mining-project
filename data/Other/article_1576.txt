November's presidential outcomepoints Democrats down the populist path, just as 2012 did for Republicans.However, Democrats' journey is potentially more politically perilous.Just weeks ago, Democrats' establishment candidate proved unable to defeat anopponent whom Democrats felt was fatally flawed. Hillary Clinton had the money,organization and ardent support of a popular sitting president and mainstreammedia ... and she still lost. The Democrat establishment that thrust her on arelatively ambivalent party shares in her defeat. Now the Democratic populistchallenge has begun.Four years ago, Republicans encountered the same thing. The Republicanestablishment's candidate was unable to exploit sizable opportunities to defeata weakened Obama. Four years later, the Republican establishment collectivelyfinished third in the nomination contest that populist Donald Trump won handily.Democrats confidently thought they had avoided Republicans' revolution. They sawthe Republican Party irreparably fracturing. Meanwhile, Obama had scratchedtheir populist itch in 2008 by upsetting their establishment's favorite, HillaryClinton.Obama had proved a fortuitous detour for Democrats too. The first Democrat totwice win the presidency with popular vote majorities since FDR, Obama appealedparticularly to their liberal wing. He also had created a powerful politicalorganization and made peace with the Democratic establishment by ordainingClinton his successor.Obama's support, and that of Democrats' superdelegates, guaranteed that thepopulist Sanders could not win. Safely united behind Clinton, Democrats wouldwin easily -- perhaps overwhelmingly -- their establishment would return topower, and the party could enjoy watching Republicans turn themselves into apermanent minority. Or so Democrats thought.When Clinton was stunningly upset, the Democratic establishment crashed too. Nowthe populist road runs to Democrats' doorstep after all. And there arecompelling reasons for taking it -- just as there were for the Republicansfollowing 2012.For one, it is already strong among Democrats. Sen. Sanders proved that,frequently winning and consistently pulling 40%-plus of the votes throughout theprimaries.For another, it works. What Sanders proved in the primaries, president-electTrump did to even greater effect in November.Another reason for Democrats' populist potential is the weakened Democraticestablishment that it would face. Simply, their bench is weak. Hillary Clintonwas their consensus candidate because they had few from whom to choose.While populism will not have problems winning over Democrats, Democrats may haveconsiderable ones winning with their brand of populism.By its nature, populism is a divisive exercise. This fractious experience istrying under any circumstances, but for the Democrats it would be particularlychallenging in the next four years.As Republicans demonstrated, infighting does not wait for presidentialelections. It begins immediately in Congress, where Democrats are particularlyvulnerable.In the Senate, they will defend a disproportionate number of seats in 2018 --just as Republicans did this year. The Democrats' problem is even larger:Republicans defended 24 seats in 2016, vs. 10 for Democrats. Democrats willdefend 25 to Republicans' 8 in 2018. So many vulnerable members will make unitydifficult, especially with additional populist pressure.In the House, Democrats also remain a minority -- unlike Republicans whocontrolled that body following Obama's first midterm. While the Senate offersthe minority ample opportunity for expressing their own positions and exertingsome control over the agenda, in the House the majority rules. Being theminority there means taking the agenda that the majority puts before you. Again,that is a difficult position for Democrats who are simultaneously seeking todeal with an internal populist challenge.Most serious of all, Democrats' brand of populism is likely to pull them awayfrom America's political center of gravity.The establishment of both parties by necessity resides as close as possible tothe political center, where America's presidential elections are decided. Sincepopulism is an uprising against the establishment, each party's version pulls ittoward its prevailing ideological pole.Republicans' version worked because it pulled toward the right and Americaremains a center-right country. According to CNN exit polling, conservativevoters outnumbered liberals by 35% to 26% (with moderates making up 39%). Trumpwon by holding 90% of Republicans and beating Clinton 48% to 42% amongindependents.Democrats' version of populism, as Sanders showed, will pull to the left -- awayfrom America's political center of gravity. It would reinforce the dynamic thatjust cost Clinton the election.Establishment Democrats who thought their party had escaped populism are likelyto be proved wrong over the next four years, and to be proved even more so ifthey imagine their trip down the populist path will go as well as theRepublicans'. If anything, their party's dynamics stands to make it even worse.     ·    Young served in the Treasury Department and the Office of Management          and Budget from 2001 to 2004 and as a Congressional staff member from          1987 to 2000.
