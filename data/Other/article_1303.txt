A14LENGTH: 325 wordsRegarding the Nov. 25 front-page article "Research ties fake news to Russia":The fake news planted in the United States during the presidential election is aserious issue that demands a serious response. While we cannot say that the fakenews in itself was the decisive factor in this election, it clearly had apernicious effect, seriously misleading voters, particularly the supporters ofRepublican presidential nominee Donald Trump. They believed outrageous andscurrilous tales about Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, storiesthat lacked even a shred of truth. If these stories were concocted by amoralentrepreneurs, this would be bad enough. The fact that the lies were concoctedand spread by Russian agents is outrageous.We now stand at the brink of inaugurating as president a man who owes aconsiderable debt to the Russians for the help they gave his campaign. Whom ishe going to serve: the people of the United States, or Russian powers thatassisted his presidential run? Any patriotic American should wonder where Mr.Trump's true loyalties lie.Eric Schwartz , Williamsport, Md.Donald Trump claimed victory  on election night, but it may be Russia who is thereal victor. The article "Research ties fake news to Russia" reported thatplanting fake news stories in politically conservative news outlets was aneffort to erode faith in U.S. democracy.In another effort to put Mr. Trump in the White House, national securityanalysts say,  Russian President Vladimir Putin and his cronies were behind thehacking of the Democratic National Committee's emails. Interestingly, in spiteof Russia's misdeeds, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton is about 2million votes ahead in the popular vote. How are we to respond to this kind ofmalicious interference in our democracy? Do we really want Russia, whose valuesare contrary to those of the United States, choosing our next president?Jo Ann Tooley , Arlington
