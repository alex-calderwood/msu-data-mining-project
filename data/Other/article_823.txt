Electoral College serves U.S.wellI beg to differ with columnist Jay Bookman's view that our nation's founders hadno idea of the potential consequences the Electoral College could and would playin electing our president ( "Sifting Through the Post-Election Debris,"Opinion,Nov. 14).They knew precisely its impact, as it was designed to protect the votes ofcitizens of less-populated states. Looking at the final electoral map, it'sobvious that a handful of populous states can easily overwhelm the vast majorityof this country. Our nation's founders served us well.WAYNE KERR,STOCKBRIDGEComey cost Clinton the electionWhat a classy, highly intelligent lady is Hillary Clinton. She is completely ontarget as to what caused her defeat -- FBI Director James Comey's two letters inthe last few days of the presidential campaign when her momentum was climbingand Donald Trump's was deteriorating.This move by James Comey, which changed the course and outcome of this election,is reflective of a style of old white men, in both the FBI and the RepublicanParty's leadership, to keep a woman from becoming America's firstCommander-in-Chief.This election changes the course of the nation's trajectory and this world'strajectory. The direction that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton were taking ournation, and world, was based upon a spiritual foundation. I see nothing butself-interest for America and for himself in Donald Trump's vision, if he evenhas a vision, for humankind beyond self-interest and division, not communion,between all the people on this planet.ELIZABETH HARTLEYFILLIAT, ALPHARETTA(Box)The AJC is dedicated to continually bringing you the best in opinion columns andguest articles on issues that matter to you.
