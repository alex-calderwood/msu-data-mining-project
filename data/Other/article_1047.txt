THE LATEST episode of Donald Trump's "The Apprentice: White House Edition"featured a special appearance by secret-spilling retired four-star general DavidPetraeus, a surprise contestant for the position of secretary of state.Petraeus - who resigned from the top job at the CIA in 2012 after sharingconfidential information with his mistress - was paraded in front of the camerasat Trump Tower before meeting with the President-elect for about an hour."He basically walked us around the world. Showed a great grasp of a variety ofthe challenges that are out there and some of the opportunities as well,"Petraeus said afterward. "Very good conversation, and we'll see where it goesfrom here."Trump tweeted following the meeting, reinforcing the aura of areality-show-style audition. "Just met with General Petraeus - was veryimpressed!" Trump wrote.The interest in Petraeus is surprising, since he pleaded guilty in 2015 tomisdemeanor mishandling of classified information for leaking info to hismistress, who was also his biographer.During the campaign, Trump maintained the general's government career was endedfor "far less" than the wrongdoing he alleged by Hillary Clinton, who used aprivate email server during her time as secretary of state. Trump said sheshould be "jailed" and egged on crowds to chant "Lock her up!"Petraeus is one of several contestants vying for the job.Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani was an early favorite, but some in Trump'steam have been pushing Trump critic and former presidential nominee Mitt Romneyfor the role.Romney met with Trump in New Jersey last week, and he's slated to audition againTuesday, as is Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), who's the chairman of the SenateForeign Relations Committee.Opposition to Romney has been fierce and public by some on the Trump team -which led to more drama Monday.Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway tweeted Sunday that Trump supporters "feelbetrayed" by the possibility Romney might get the job. That claim made Trump"furious" at Conway, MSNBC's "Morning Joe" reported.A source said Trump felt Conway "went rogue at Donald Trump's expense at theworst possible time," according to host Mika Brzezinski.It's unclear when Trump will make his decision. He tweeted earlier this month,"Only I know who the finalists are!"
