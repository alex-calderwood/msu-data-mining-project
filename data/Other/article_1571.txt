Thefoundation also agreed to limit foreign donations.Both agreements were for good reasons. Foreign officials and governments werebig donors to the Clintons' family foundation, and there were concerns in theObama administration about conflicts of interest between the foundation andHillary Clinton's work at Secretary of State.But over the past year, evidence has emerged that both Clinton and thefoundation failed to live up to those promises. Clinton and her top officialscontinued to have a cozy relationship with the foundation throughout her tenureat State, and evidence strongly suggest that Clinton was granting access andfavors to major Clinton Foundation donors.In addition, the Clinton Foundation accepted millions of donations from foreigngovernments while Hillary was at State, including one that violated an ethicsagreement it had with the Obama administration.The story came to light after the release of a groundbreaking book by PeterSchweizer -- called "Clinton Cash" -- which uncovered a serious of StateDepartment decisions that appeared to favor big Clinton Foundation donors.Emails that emerged more recently made it clear that donors received specialaccess and attention from Clinton and her top aides. An AP story found that morethan half the private visitors Clinton received at State were donors to herfamily foundation.[ibd-display-posts title="Clinton Foundation Scandal: Latest Commentary"title_link="http://www.investors.com/tag/clinton-foundation-scandal/"posts_per_page="18" image_size="thumbnail" include_content="true"content_length="30" category="" tag="171871" ]RELATED:Clinton Vs.
