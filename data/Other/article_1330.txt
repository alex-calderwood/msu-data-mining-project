B05LENGTH: 1929 wordssays there is nothing to prevent the president from launching a nuclear weapon -by designSometime in the next few weeks, Donald Trump will be briefed on the proceduresfor how to activate the U.S. nuclear arsenal, if he hasn't already learned aboutthem.All year, the prospect of giving the real estate and reality TV mogul the powerto launch attacks that would kill millions of people was one of the main reasonshis opponents argued against electing him. "A man you can bait with a tweet isnot a man we can trust with nuclear weapons," Hillary Clinton said in her speechaccepting the Democratic presidential nomination. She cut an ad along the samelines. Republicans who didn't support Trump - and even some who did, such asSen. Marco Rubio (Fla.) - also said they didn't think he could be trusted withthe launch codes.Now they're his. When Trump takes office in January, he will have sole authorityover more than 7,000  warheads. There is no failsafe. The whole point of U.S.nuclear weapons control is to make sure that the president - and only thepresident - can use them if and whenever he decides to do so. The one sure wayto keep President Trump from launching a nuclear attack, under the system we'vehad in place since the early Cold War, would have been to elect someone else.When the legal framework for nuclear weapons was developed, the fear wasn'tabout irrational presidents but trigger-happy generals. The Atomic Energy Act of1946, which was passed with President Harry Truman's signature after nine monthsof acrimonious congressional hearings, firmly put the power of the atomic bombin the hands of the president and the civilian components of the executivebranch. It was a momentous and controversial law, crafted in the monthsfollowing the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, with an eye towardfuture standoffs with the Soviet Union.The members of Congress who wrote the law, largely with the backing of thescientists who worked on the Manhattan Project, framed it explicitly as aquestion of who controls the power to use nuclear weapons: Is dropping an atomicbomb a military act or a political one? If it is inherently political, above andbeyond a regular military tactic, then that power could not be entrusted to themilitary. Ultimately, the president was supposed to be the check against thePentagon pushing to use nukes more often.The scientists' fears were based in their experiences in World War II. Theirwork under the Army Corps of Engineers and the Army Air Forces left them with asour taste: Generals, they concluded, cared little about ethics, democracy orinternational politics. Even during the war, some civilians involved withatomic-bombing work feared that the military had become too eager to leaveGerman and Japanese cities in cinders. The secretary of war, Henry Stimson,learned about the ruinous firebombing of Tokyo from the press. He warned Trumanthat letting the military run the show might cause the United States to "get thereputation of outdoing Hitler in atrocities."This division between military and civilian control over nuclear weapons hasbeen weaker or stronger at various points. In the late 1940s, U.S. nuclearweapons could have their nuclear components - the plutonium or uranium "pits"needed to start their reactions - removed and inserted as needed. The nuclearparts of the atomic bombs were in the custody of the civilian Atomic EnergyCommission (the precursor to the present-day Energy Department), while themilitary controlled the nonnuclear parts. The president had the power totransfer these pits to the military and order their use.During the Eisenhower administration, more compact and complex weapons weredeveloped whose nuclear and nonnuclear parts could not be separated. Fearing aSoviet sneak attack, President Dwight D. Eisenhower put the military in chargeof most of the U.S. nuclear stockpile to streamline a possible response.Eisenhower also "pre-delegated" authority to the military to use tacticalnuclear weapons (aimed at tanks, not cities) without getting specificpresidential approval in certain situations, such as if Soviet tank columnsrolled into Germany's Fulda Gap.Fears of low-level commanders setting off nuclear conflagrations during thetensions of the early 1960s persuaded President John F. Kennedy to dial some ofthis back. Miscommunications during the Cuban missile crisis almost led to theuse of nuclear weapons by both U.S. and Soviet troops, and U.S. weaponsstationed abroad, such as the Jupiter missiles in Turkey, could be used by anyarmy that seized control of them. There were also lingering concerns about"Strangelove"-esque rogue generals. The head of the Strategic Air Command, Gen.Thomas Power, was an enthusiastic proponent of preemptive nuclear war.Similar concerns within the upper reaches of the Kennedy administration led to apush for technologies to "lock" the nuclear weapons and prevent their usewithout some kind of codes or authorization. Some early versions were asprimitive as combination locks, but later versions were complexelectro-mechanical systems that could physically disable a weapon if it weretampered with or if the wrong code was entered too many times.Eventually, the brass adopted the idea that, when it came to nuclear matters,they were at the beck and call of the president. It was not generals'responsibility to make the order; it was their responsibility to carry it out.That the president would be the only person competent to use nuclear weapons wasnever challenged. Even asking the question would throw the entire system intodisarray, as Maj. Harold Hering learned in 1973. Hering was a 21-year Air Forceveteran who was decorated for his flying in Vietnam before being sent fortraining as a nuclear missile squadron commander. He had been taught thatofficers had an obligation to disobey illegal orders. So when he was told how tolaunch a nuclear attack, he asked what seemed like a simple question: How couldhe be sure that an order to launch his missiles was lawful? How could he besure, for example, that the president wasn't insane? Instead of an answer, hegot the boot: an aborted promotion and an administrative discharge for "failureto demonstrate acceptable qualities of leadership" and for indicating "adefective mental attitude towards his duties."The Air Force's problem, in short, is that once a serviceman starts down therabbit hole of doubt, he becomes an unreliable second-guesser - and suddenly heis one of the few people who can decide whether nuclear weapons are used.The procedure for ordering a nuclear attack involves more than one person: Thepresident cannot literally press a button on his desk and start World War III.There is no "nuclear button" at all. Instead, the U.S. nuclearcommand-and-control system is bureaucratically and technically complex,stretching out to encompass land-based missile silos, submarine-based ballisticand cruise missiles, and weapons capable of being dropped from bombers. Thechain of command requires that the president order the secretary of defense tocarry out a launch; the secretary serves as the conduit for implementation bythe military. There are succession policies in place so that the procedure canbe continued in the event of the death or incapacitation of either the presidentor the secretary of defense - or their designated successors.Most details of how a nuclear war would be started are classified, because anenemy who knew enough about the system could come up with ways to complicate ordefeat it. What is known is that an aide is always following the president,carrying at least one large satchel (often two) known as the "nuclear football,"reportedly containing information about nuclear attack possibilities and how thepresident could verify his identity, authenticate orders and communicate withthe military about implementing them.Could the secretary of defense refuse to carry out a presidential order for anuclear attack? The legal and constitutional aspects are not clear. The officialdoctrine that has been released says nothing about this question, and thecryptic public responses to official inquiries, even from Congress, indicatethat it is not something that can be openly talked about. "Only the presidentcan authorize the use of nuclear weapons" is essentially the only replyofficials ever give to any questions about nuclear controls. Could the presidentsimply fire the defense secretary and move on to the deputy secretary, thesecretary of the Army and so on through the chain of command? Maybe. Such anaction would at least slow things down, even if the refusal to carry out theorder was illegal.Commanders further down the pipeline are trained to act quickly on any ordersthat do come in. The launch officers are trained to launch weapons, not todebate the legality or advisability of the action. Hence the problem withHering's question in 1973: While nuclear launch officers are not meant to bestrictly mechanical (and indeed, the United States has always resisted fullyautomating the process), if they stopped to question whether their authenticatedorders were legitimate, they would put the credibility of U.S. nucleardeterrence at risk.Though Congress held hearings on these questions in the mid-1970s, nothing cameof them. The debate faded away except among a small circle of nuclear wonks. Inthe early 1980s, Jeremy Stone, then the president of the Federation of AmericanScientists, proposed that Congress  pass a law restricting presidential use ofnuclear weapons. The idea was fairly simple: So long as no nuclear weapons hadbeen used by another power in a conflict, the president should not be able toorder a first strike with nuclear weapons without getting approval from a fairlylarge committee of high-ranking members of Congress. It would not eliminate thepossibility of an American first strike but would spread the responsibility moredemocratically.The idea was pooh-poohed by legal scholars, who noted that Congress has oftenbeen far more belligerent than presidents and that the logistics could becomplicated.The people who set up the current command-and-control system did believe therewas a check in place: elections. Don't want an insane president to have nuclearweapons? Don't put one in office. But this isn't necessarily much of a check -even rational presidents have bad days; even high-functioning people succumb tomental illness or substance abuse.It might be worth resurrecting this debate , if we take seriously the idea thatpresidents - any of them, much less Trump - should not have the legal authorityto conduct arbitrary and unilateral nuclear war. Perhaps now, decades after theend of the Cold War, we are past the moment when we need to entrust that powerin a single person. One can imagine a law that would allow the president to usenuclear weapons in the face of imminent danger, the sort of situation in which amatter of minutes or even seconds could make a difference, but would enactformal requirements for outside consensus when more options were on the table.It would not require a full renunciation of the possibility of a first-strikenuclear attack (something the United States has never been willing to make) butmight add some reassurances that such decisions would not be made unilaterally.Congress ceded a considerable amount of power to the presidency in 1946. Seventyyears later, maybe it is time lawmakers took some of it back.Twitter: @wellerstein
