As Philadelphians explore ways to mobilize politically in the wake of thepresidential election, consider the story of the Pennsylvania State Equal RightsLeague (the League), the black-led organization undaunted by intimidation andviolence in its fight for African American rights.Despite emancipation and the conspicuous bravery of nearly 180,000 AfricanAmerican soldiers in the Union Army, Philadelphia's black communities continuedto be rankled after the Civil War by systematic segregation."More unmerciful in her proscription of colored men than any other city in theUnion," denounced the Christian Recorder.Founded in New York in 1864 by Fredrick Douglass and other prominent blackleaders to "make legal equality a reality" for African Americans, the NationalEqual Rights League soon sponsored state branches stretching from North Carolinato Louisiana. The Pennsylvania chapter emerged that same year.In Philadelphia, under the direction of athlete and activist Octavius Catto, theLeague "pledged to leave no means untried to regain those rights of which we,citizens of the United States and citizens of Pennsylvania, have been so cruellyand unjustifiably deprived."The organization first set its sights on the city's streetcar segregation.Working with Thaddeus Stevens and other radical Republicans, the Leaguesuccessfully lobbied Harrisburg to pass a statewide ban on the forcible evictionof African American trolley riders.Securing black male enfranchisement, however, remained the "all importantsubject of our deliberations and united action."In an address before a joint session of Congress in 1866, members of the Leagueput it plainly: "Will you, to whom we have given our money in taxes, our livesin battle, to maintain the supremacy of law against secession and anarchy,continue to deprive us of this dearly purchased right to the ballot?"Through public rallies, petitions, letter-writing campaigns, and other peacefulforms of agitation, the League fought for the passage and ratification of the15th Amendment. This guaranteed, in part: "The right of citizens of the UnitedStates to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by anyState on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude."But like the Emancipation Proclamation before it, the 15th Amendment did littleto change the facts on the ground."Even then, in the state's largest city, it was only under the protection of acompany of U.S. Marines . . . that black Philadelphians were able to cast theirvotes unmolested by white mobs," observed historian Andrew Diemer.Catto himself was assassinated on Election Day 1871. His likeness will soonadorn the southwest apron of City Hall."The story of black citizenship rights is not, then, one of unambiguoussuccess," Diemer continued. "It is rather a story of constant struggle."A struggle that persists to this day.The latest issues of Legacies and the Pennsylvania Magazine of History &Biography explore citizenship, ethnicity, and immigration throughout thecommonwealth's 300-plus-year existence.
