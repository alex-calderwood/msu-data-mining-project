HARRISBURG - The Green Party-backed push for a recount of Pennsylvania'spresidential election results will get its day in court.Commonwealth Court has scheduled a hearing for 10 a.m. Monday in Harrisburg toconsider the recount effort pushed by former Green Party presidential candidateJill Stein, according to a court order Tuesday.Stein's campaign helped coordinate a legal challenge this week seeking thestatewide recount, contending the Nov. 8 election was illegal and its resultsinaccurate.It cited as evidence research by computer scientists pointing to potentialhacking of electronic voting machines, as well as numerous news reports ofhacking, possibly by foreign governments, into email accounts associated withthe Democratic National Committee and the campaign chairman for Hillary Clinton.In scheduling Monday's hearing, the court order said little about theproceeding. But it said "a conclusive decision" on the matter must be reached byDec. 13, the deadline for Pennsylvania's electors to declare who wins thestate's 20 electoral votes.The recount petition was filed Monday on behalf of at least 100 Pennsylvaniavoters.Election-law experts said they expect lawyers for Stein's campaign will need toproduce concrete evidence of election irregularities to bolster their case for arecount."I would expect that the court, in order to hold this up, will need to see morethan what was contained in their pleading," said one, Kathleen Jones Goldman, aBuchanan, Ingersoll & Rooney lawyer who chairs the Pittsburgh chapter of theRepublican National Lawyers Association but has no role in this case.Stein has raised upward of $6 million to finance recount efforts in three keystates - Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan - that sealed President-electDonald Trump's victory over Clinton. A Wisconsin recount could begin Thursday.Clinton lost by less than 100,000 votes in all three states, which have a recenthistory of backing Democrats.Republicans have decried the effort in Pennsylvania as an act of desperation bya failed campaign. They have also promised to challenge any recount efforts.Pedro Cortes, who as Pennsylvania secretary of state serves as the state's topelection officer, has said repeatedly that there has been no evidence of voterirregularities on Election Day.Besides the Commonwealth Court petition, Stein's campaign is helping organizerecount efforts at the precinct level in at least a half-dozen counties acrossthe state.A spokesman for Stein's campaign said Tuesday that such requests have focused onsix of the state's vote-rich counties, including Philadelphia, Montgomery,Bucks, and Allegheny. It will be up to judges and elections officials in thosecounties to act on the petitions.In all, 260 precinct-level recount challenges have been filed, the campaignsaid, with that number expected to rise.
