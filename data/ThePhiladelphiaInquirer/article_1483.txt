Green Party candidate Jill Stein has raised nearly $4 million to pursue anelection recount in three key Rust Belt states won by Donald Trump, includingPennsylvania.Stein's campaign launched an online fund-raising effort Wednesday seeking $2.5million by Friday evening. As of Thursday afternoon, just over $3.7 million hadbeen raised toward a newly updated goal of $4.5 million, according to a reportby the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.The funds are needed to post bonds necessary for recounts in Pennsylvania,Wisconsin, and Michigan. The deadline for contesting Pennsylvania's electionresults is Monday.The effort follows a report, published in New York Magazine Tuesday, that someelection lawyers and computer experts suspect election returns "may have beenmanipulated or hacked" in those three states.In some areas, they detected a pattern in which Democrat Hillary Clinton faredworse in precincts where votes were recorded electronically, without a papertrail to confirm the digital record is correct, the Post-Gazette reported.Philadelphia, along with two-thirds of Pennsylvania counties, uses suchmachines, which experts have demonstrated can be hacked even without beinghooked up to the internet, according to the Post-Gazette.The basis for this week's concerns, however, appears to be purelycircumstantial. One of the experts in the magazine report, University ofMichigan computer scientist J. Alex Halderman, wrote separately that machineshad "probably not" been hacked, but the only way to be sure was "to closelyexamine the available physical evidence."The Clinton campaign has not pressed for recounts, and Democrats seemed dubiousabout the notion on Wednesday, according to the Post-Gazette article."If there were something to do here, there are a lot of us who would be jumpingon it," said Adam Bonin, a Philadelphia election-law attorney who representsDemocrats.Bonin said that while every election has "little hitches and glitches, I haven'tseen anything which would cause me to question the results." Nor, he said, "haveI ever seen evidence that would lead me to call the machines into question. . .. You can't just go on a fishing expedition. You have to have allegations ofspecific fraud, or machines that didn't accept votes."The deadline to file for recounts in Wisconsin is Friday, and in Michigan,Wednesday."After a divisive and painful presidential race, reported hacks into voter andparty databases and individual email accounts are causing many Americans towonder if our election results are reliable," Stein stated on her website."These concerns need to be investigated before the 2016 presidential election iscertified. We deserve elections we can trust."Carl Romanelli, the Stein campaign's Pennsylvania field coordinator, told thePost-Gazette he wasn't aware of problems in the state."I haven't spoken with party representatives about complaints that may have comein," he said. But "voter integrity is one of our huge issues, and the Steincampaign appears to be taking the lead on making sure the public can trust itselections."He added: "I don't want anyone to get the impression that this is aboutaffecting the outcome of the election."Trump's lead in Pennsylvania is roughly 70,000 votes.Clinton campaign officials have not commented and were concerned the issue woulddisrupt the transfer of power or cause further unrest over Trump's win,according to NBC News.While Trump has been silent on the recount efforts, his former campaign managerKellyanne Conway tweeted Thursday:"Look who can't accept the election results Hillary Clinton Supporters Call forVote Recount in Battleground States."mschaefer@phillynews.com@MariSchaefer
