Some snapped pictures, others watched intently, as an official recount of 75Philadelphia voting divisions took place Friday afternoon at the city's massivevoting machine warehouse in Nicetown.The recount of 4 percent of the city's 1,686 divisions was a result of acampaign launched by Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein in countiesand states throughout the country.The Philadelphia city commissioners, who make up the Board of Elections, agreedto recount ballots in the 75 divisions, in each of which there were at leastthree affidavits from voters asking for a recount. They rejected the request fora forensic audit of the machines' software.The recount will continue Sunday morning at the commissioners' Front and SpringGarden Street offices. Representatives of each party will be invited to see arecount of the provisional, absentee, overseas, and military ballots filed inthe 75 divisions.On Friday, Board of Elections employees broke the representatives from theDemocratic, Green, and Republican Parties into three groups of about six orseven to go through the machines. Each group got 25 divisions.As they went from machine to machine, an employee would print out that machine'svoting receipt, which showed every vote made on it. The party representativesstood and watched. Some took pictures and videos. The groups latercross-referenced every receipt with the machine's cartridge.But what Stein supporters really wanted was the forensic audit."The electronic result and the paper result come from the same source. So thisis like wanting to get a second opinion and going back to the same doctor," saidRich Garella, a South Philadelphia Stein supporter who filled out an affidavitto get the recount.Stein won 6,486 votes in Philadelphia, or 0.95 percent of the ballots cast. Shewon 0.82 percent of the vote in Pennsylvania and 1 percent nationwide.President-elect Donald Trump, the Republican candidate, defeated Democraticnominee Hillary Clinton in Pennsylvania by 1.1 percentage points.The 75 divisions overwhelmingly supported Clinton. That didn't matter toGarella. His concern is the integrity of the machines, he said."It's not more or less important to look at a place where Clinton did well orTrump did well or Stein did well," Garella said. "All the votes are going in onebasket for the whole state. This is why this is a statewide effort."Green Party officials have said that they have testimony from computerscientists that voting machines are vulnerable to hacking.The city commissioners have said that the machines are not connected to theinternet. Regardless, they note, there is nothing in the election code thatdictates forensic audits."They are asking for something we don't do," Commissioner Lisa Deeley saidFriday. "They just can't get hacked. They can't." Deeley said the machines donot have WiFi or any way to be connected to the internet.Representatives from the Republican Party sided with the commissioners, sayingthe machines could not be hacked."It's very standard stuff. No machine malfunctions, no difficulty printing," TomStoner, a local Republican, said. "We don't believe there will be anyanomalies."Nevertheless, he said the recount was "fair game.""People have the right to check," he said.As the groups made their way through the dozens of rows of beige votingmachines, Christmas music played through the loudspeakers.Board of Elections employees were cleaning out machines that weren't part of therecount, refolding the curtains and tucking them away until the next election.cvargas@phillynews.com215-854-5520 @InqCVargasTrump, backers ask courts to halt or block 3 state recountshttp://www.philly.com/philly/news/politics/presidential/20161202_ap_d0b5ceb090e44e34bf0d7665ddd188b4.htmlPhilly allows recount, rejects forensic audit of voting machineshttp://www.philly.com/philly/news/politics/20161202_Philly_allows_recount__rejects_forensic_audit_of_voting_machines.htmlMontco judge rejects presidential-vote recount requesthttp://www.philly.com/philly/news/politics/presidential/20161201_Montco_judge_rejects_presidential-vote_recount_request.htmlPa. court sets hearing for Stein recount petitionhttp://www.philly.com/philly/news/politics/presidential/20161130_Pa__court_sets_hearing_for_Stein_recount_petition.html
