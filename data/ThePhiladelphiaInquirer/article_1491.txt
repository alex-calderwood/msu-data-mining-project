A Montgomery County Court judge rejected a petition Wednesday to recanvass votesin some of the county's precincts, turning down a request by Green Partypresidential candidate Jill Stein's campaign, which is seeking a recount ofvotes in Pennsylvania.Judge Bernard A. Moore dismissed the petitions for recounts in 72 of the 425precincts at the end of a brief hearing Wednesday afternoon, offering no reasonfor his ruling.The petitions were part of an effort by Stein's campaign to seek a statewiderecount. The campaign filed a petition in Commonwealth Court that is scheduledfor consideration Monday. Voters also have filed petitions seeking recounts incounties around the state.In Philadelphia, the Board of Elections announced it would meet Thursday morningto review petitions for recounts in 82 of its 1,686 divisions and determinewhich divisions would be reexamined.Some top Democrats and Hillary Clinton supporters, meanwhile, suggested that arecount is a waste of resources."Believe me, if there was anything I could do to make Hillary Clinton the nextpresident of the United States, I would," said former Gov. Ed Rendell, alongtime supporter. "But this is a big waste of time."U.S. Sen. Bob Casey, a Democrat, also said he does not expect the results tochange."People are free to pursue a recount, but my focus is on the work that needs tobe done in remainder of this Congress," he said.In Montgomery County on Wednesday, a solicitor for the Election Board andattorneys for President-elect Donald Trump and the state Republican Partyopposed the Green Party's petitions, each of which was signed by three voters.They called the recount request a "fishing expedition" and asked the judge toreject it, based in part on a technicality: The petitioners did not file $50cash with each petition, as required under state law.Ilann Maazel, an attorney for Stein's campaign, said the 72 Montgomery Countypetitions were filed with a fee of $269.50 each, as required by theProthonotary's Office, which should have been more than enough to cover any cashrequirement for recounts.Maazel said a recanvassing of votes and forensic examination of voting machinesin the county would be important because machines are "vulnerable to malware"and are easier to hack than an iPhone. There has been an "enormous effort tointerfere with American elections," he said, citing the hacking of DemocraticNational Committee emails. He told the judge that the campaign had forensicexperts ready to begin examining voting machines immediately for possiblehacking if their request was granted.Senior Assistant County Solicitor Nicole Forzato argued that the request for arecount was based on speculation and that recounts cannot be conducted as"fishing expeditions.""Those machines can't be hacked," she said, adding that Montgomery County'svoting machines are not connected to the internet and that she could offer anexpert who could testify about the matter.Lawrence Tabas, an attorney for Trump's campaign and general counsel for thestate Republican Party, said that petitioners should not be permitted tocherry-pick precincts for recounts."It would insult the term 'Hail Mary' to even say that's what it is," Tabas saidof the recount efforts.Moore, a Republican senior judge, ruled from the bench. While Maazel criticizedRepublican Party lawyers for opposing the recount petition, Montgomery County'sadministration is controlled by Democrats and the county's solicitor alsoopposed it.Trump defeated Clinton in Pennsylvania by about 71,000 votes.Maazel said after the hearing that he would meet with his team and determinewhether to appeal. He said he expects recount requests in some other countieswill be granted, and he is preparing for the hearing in Commonwealth Court onMonday.In an announcement of its Thursday morning meeting, the Philadelphia Board ofElections said it was prepared to begin a recount immediately after examiningthe petitions.A Chester County spokeswoman said Wednesday that the county was still reviewingpetitions it received for recounts in 139 of its 228 precincts.Stein knows she would not become president as a result of a recount, but wantsto "to get to the truth, Maazel said. "She wants to make sure that every votewas counted accurately."lmccrystal@philly.com610-313-8116@LMcCrystalStaff writers Michaelle Bond, Chris Brennan, and Jonathan Tamari contributed tothis article.This article contains information form the Associated Press.Stein makes Michigan third state for presidential recounthttp://www.philly.com/philly/news/politics/presidential/20161130_ap_b4a3525d46d043098a035f454d819c58.htmlRendell: Stein recount effort 'a big waste of time'http://www.philly.com/philly/news/politics/presidential/20161130_ap_Ed_Rendell_Clinton_recount_waste_of_time.htmlDetails about election recount request in Pennsylvaniahttp://www.philly.com/philly/news/politics/20161129_ap_9c0e5bf7a1aa4073a05b73b388d80a18.htmlPa. court sets hearing for Stein recount petitionhttp://www.philly.com/philly/news/politics/presidential/20161130_Pa__court_sets_hearing_for_Stein_recount_petition.html
