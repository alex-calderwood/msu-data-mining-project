Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi did little to tamp down speculation that shecould be leaving to join the administration of President-elect Donald Trumpafter the pair met Friday at New York's Trump Tower.Bondi, a member of Trump's transition team, told reporters that she is "AG ofFlorida, right now," underscoring her current post when asked whether she wouldtake a job in the new administration."I'm very happy being attorney general of the state of Florida right now," Bondisaid.But her departure could knock over some dominoes in Florida, as possiblecontenders angle to fill her coveted spot on the state's Cabinet.Bondi has waited and watched as Trump has filled the two highest-profile legaljobs in his administration with Alabama Republican U.S. Sen. Jeff Sessions forattorney general and Don McGahn for White House counsel.Talk of a possible Bondi post now centers on the White House Office of NationalDrug Control Policy, the nation's drug czar.Bondi has been outspoken in urging state and federal action against prescriptiondrug addiction, a problem Trump also called a "tremendous problem" and vowed toaddress during his campaign for the White House.Bondi is term-limited, with just over a year left as attorney general. If sheleaves sooner, Gov. Rick Scott gets to appoint her successor.Serving as interim attorney general could be a good stepping stone for anyonelooking to capture the Cabinet post outright in 2018 .Among possible Bondi replacements are Pete Antonacci, now executive director ofthe South Florida Water Management District, but a former Scott general counselwhom the governor earlier also tapped to serve as an interim Palm Beach Countystate attorney. Antonacci was former Democratic Attorney General BobButterworth's top deputy for years."He serves at the pleasure of the governing board (of the SFWMD)," districtspokesman Randy Smith said Thursday, relaying what he said were Antonacci'scomments when asked about the attorney general post. "And he loves his job."Other names in the mix: Bondi's current chief of staff, Kent Perez; state Rep.Jose Felix Diaz, R-Miami; former Department of Economic Opportunity chief JessePanuccio; Tom Grady, a Scott neighbor in Naples and former head of CitizensProperty Insurance Corp.; and two legislative leaders, Senate President JoeNegron, R-Stuart, and House Speaker Richard Corcoran, R-Land O'Lakes, who bothare considered long shots because they'd have to surrender top posts aslawmakers.First elected in 2010, Bondi was an early supporter of Trump and spoke at theRepublican National Convention in Cleveland.During the presidential campaign, she came under fire for her acceptance of a$25,000 campaign check for her own re-election run from the Donald J. TrumpFoundation shortly before announcing two years ago that she would not act oncomplaints involving Trump University.She spoke publicly about the matter for the first time in September, defendingherself for asking Trump for the money in the first place and for not returningthe contribution even after New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman filed alawsuit alleging fraud at Trump University.Politics writer George Bennett of the Palm Beach Post contributed to thisreport. jkennedy@pbpost.com Twitter: @jkennedyreport
