After a presidential election unlike any other, many people are reacting to theresults like they never quite have before.Some school leaders have taken the unprecedented step of having to calm fears ofstudents who are so tense from an election that elevated Donald J. Trump to theWhite House.At UMass Lowell, Chancellor Jacqueline Moloney and the school's Office ofMulticultural Affairs staff both sent messages to the campus community after theelection."These are unprecedented times," the multicultural affairs office said in anemail signed by Director Leslie Wong and others. "This is a critical time tomake sure that you, your friends, classmates, neighbors are doing OK and seekingthe appropriate support, especially if they need a place to process or workthrough what they're feeling."The office held what it called a "post-election self-care session" the day afterthe election, with stress-reduction techniques.Moloney wrote to the university community saying she wanted to "acknowledge theuncertainty and fear that many in our community are feeling.""I want you to know," the chancellor said, "that our commitment to justice,respect for one another and, above all, your safety has not wavered."She added: "To our students, faculty and staff, I promise you this: You arewelcome here. Your voice matters. You matter."Moloney included information for how to contact the university's WellnessCenter, police and other offices.Neither message mentioned the candidates specifically, much less the campaignpledges Trump made, including that he would deport undocumented immigrants andhalt Muslims looking to enter the country. The college said the messages wereplanned before the election and not the result of the election results or anyspecific incident."I just wanted to acknowledge obviously some people were concerned after theelection, that the university would continue to do what we're doing," Moloneysaid in an interview. "Either way, the election has been very divisive."Trump's election has sparked protests across the nation, with some studentswalking out of high school or college classes and taking to the streets.Clearly, the election has brought out tension among supporters of both HillaryClinton and Trump, and those who weren't enamored with either candidate. The Sunsolicited through its Facebook page comments from college students who feltfearful or threatened because of the election results. No student came forward.But The Sun received a flood of comments, many from apparent Trump supporters,criticizing students for not being tougher -- and the newspaper for giving thosepeople a voice.A Lowell native and University of New Hampshire student, Daniel Landry, said hewas disappointed in The Sun for "adding fuel to this flame of students feelingthreatened.""What the media, and apparently you, are teaching these kids is that democracyis only OK when it works in their favor," he said. "That it is OK to claim thatyou feel threatened when your candidate loses, or riot in the streets."Political observers say it's no surprise that many people feel tense, or thatthere appears to be wider divide than ever among voters.A Pew poll several weeks before the election found that four-fifths ofrespondents said that most Clinton and Trump supporters didn't just disagreeover policies but also on "basic facts."Most also weren't thrilled with their choices for president. A poll this summerby ABC News and The Washington Post found 58 percent of voters to be unhappywith the Clinton-Trump match-up.In September, another Pew poll found that most Republicans planned to vote forTrump more out of opposition to Clinton than in support for their own party'snominee. Clinton herself barely surpassed Trump among Democrats asked whethertheir vote was more for her versus against him.Political leanings aside, the election results have hit a nerve with an unusualnumber of Americans. Psychology Today posted on its website about dealing with"post-election blues." Calls to crisis-support hotlines reportedly spiked as thepresidential results came in.Incidents of hate crimes, particularly aimed at Muslims, and other minoritieshave been on the rise this year.Since Nov. 8, the Southern Poverty Law Center has begun soliciting hate-crimeincidents related to the election. The NAACP on Tuesday issued a statementsaying the election has "emboldened white supremacists across the country."There have also been election-related incidents across the country since theelection. Last week, two Babson College students drove through Wellesley College-- Clinton's alma mater -- waving a Trump flag and being "disruptive," thecollege said.Some other colleges have also taken steps to help students deal with theelection results.At Middlesex Community College, Rebecca Newell, the assistant dean of students,said the school was committed to encouraging respectful discussion about theelection and how people are affected. Newell distributed safety pins that someare wearing as signs of solidarity, and the college set up a white board in theBedford campus center to allow people to leave their thoughts."People are definitely talking," she said.Newell sent a message to students the day before the election, saying thatregardless of the outcome, "you may also be feeling anxious about how it willimpact you.""While we may be living in a time of uncertainty and amidst constant change, wewill work together in a climate of civility and respect," she added.UMass President Marty Meehan office sent out a statement this week, reaffirmingthe university system's "commitment to diversity and inclusion.""We have seen many reports of increased incidents of hate, harassment andintimidation across the nation over the past week," Meehan said.At Fitchburg State University, President Richard Lapidus sent a message to thecampus community saying the university "remains committed to being a welcomingcommunity to all."Fitchburg spokesman Matthew Bruun said the university met with several studentswho expressed concern about the election in the days afterward, but that thevolume has slowed since then.Schools have been especially responsive to the election.Boston Public Schools offered counseling to students to what SuperintendentTommy Chang said were students who "may be having a difficult time processingany fears or concerns they may have.""We honor our democratic values and traditions," he said in a letter tostudents, staff and parents, "and we will carry on with our mission to educate,support and prepare our students for success."Follow Grant Welker on Twitter and Tout @SunGrantWelker.
