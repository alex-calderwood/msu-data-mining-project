By Katie LannanSTATE HOUSE NEWS SERVICEBOSTON -- On the steps of the State House Monday, before a large crowd ontoBeacon Street, Harvard Law student Harmann Singh told a crowd that he was"aggressively accosted" in a store in Cambridge last week, followed around andscreamed at by a man who thought he was a Muslim.Singh, who is a Sikh, said he shared that story to show that intolerance canhappen anywhere and many Americans have felt unsafe in the days since the Nov. 8presidential election won by Republican Donald Trump, who defeated DemocratHillary Clinton following a campaign marked by division and heated rhetoric."The movement against such hate transcends political and personal identities,"Singh said during a rally attended by several of the state's top politicalfigures. "We must stand up against it collectively, no matter where or when itoccurs."The rally was held by the Anti-Defamation League and a coalition of 30 localgroups in response to what the organizers described as "an alarming number ofhate and bias fueled incidents across the country and in Massachusetts."Elected officials who spoke at the event called on ralliers to protect theirneighbors, oppose hatred and remain involved in the political process, whilepledging that state government would work to protect Massachusetts residents.Attorney General Maura Healey said a hotline her office established forresidents to report bias-motivated harassment and hate crimes has receivednearly 400 calls since its launch a week ago.Healey said that in the past two weeks, a Puerto Rican couple in WestSpringfield found the words "go home" keyed into their car, Ku Klux Klannewspapers were delivered to homes in Milford, and racist graffiti was found inan Attleboro High School bathroom.Though few speakers referred to President-elect Trump by name, Healey andTreasurer Deb Goldberg both criticized his recent Cabinet appointees, whichHealey called "really disturbing."The crowd booed as Goldberg named some of the appointees -- Republican NationalCommittee Chairman Reince Priebus, U.S. Sen. Jeff Sessions and Steve Bannon, whoheaded Trump's campaign."We cannot afford to wait and see," Goldberg said of the Trump administration,going on to reference a warning by Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel to "never befooled.""I'm not accusing anyone in particular of being an anti-Semite or beinganti-everyone, but I am accusing them of -- I am accusing them of nurturing,mentoring, taking advantage of and feeding the underbelly of the animal fortheir own interests," Goldberg said.Gov. Charlie Baker, a Republican who was critical of Trump during thepresidential race, said last week there was "way too much pre-judging going on"as Trump announced early Cabinet picks and that he would follow President BarackObama's lead in waiting to judge the Trump administration "by the totality ofits appointments."Baker did not attend Monday's rally, which organizers attributed to a schedulingconflict, but sent along a letter expressing his support."Our strength as a community lies in Massachusetts' diversity and openness tothe world. The commonwealth has been and always will be a welcoming state," saidthe letter, which was read at the event by Anti-Defamation League RobertTrestan, the Anti-Defamation League's regional director.Though all the elected officials who attended the rally were Democrats, BostonMayor Martin Walsh urged a bipartisan approach and called on attendees to seekout common ground."We should be tolerant of many different views," Walsh said. "We should respectthe Democratic process but we will not remain neutral when hate rears its uglyhead."House Speaker Robert DeLeo said that it is the duty of state government to"protect all of our residents, no matter what is going on in Washington," andsaid that while members of the House may disagree on policy matters, "we areunited in opposing hatred and opposing intolerance."Senate President Stan Rosenberg read a statement that he said reflected "thesentiments of all 40 members of the Massachusetts Senate.""To those who feel threatened by recent events, be assured that our beliefremains steadfast: everyone is entitled to the same rights and protections, andwe will stand by your side to uphold the law," the statement said.Other elected officials who attended included Reps. Lori Ehrlich, JonathanHecht, David Linsky, Daniel Cullinane, Byron Rushing and Daniel Ryan; Sens.Karen Spilka, Thomas McGee, Cynthia Creem and Linda Dorcena Forry; Senator-electJulian Cyr; Suffolk County Sheriff Steven Tompkins; Suffolk District AttorneyDaniel Conley; and Boston City Councilors Josh Zakim and Matt O'Malley.
