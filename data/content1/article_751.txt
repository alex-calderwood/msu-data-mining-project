A small Japanese company that specializes in rubber masks has been unable todeal with a sudden surge in demand for Donald Trump masks since his surprisevictory in the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 8."We can't keep up with demand -- it will take us until mid-December to catch upwith the orders we have now," Takahiro Yagihara, factory manager at OgawaStudios, which makes the masks, tells The Hollywood Reporter.The company began making the $21.65 ( 2,400) Trump masks in May for Halloweenand had sold about 600 by the end of October, but it received orders for threetimes that amount right after the election, Yagihara said.The company sold about 450 Hillary Clinton masks for Halloween, even thoughopinion polls in Japan before the election found around 90 percent of localpeople believed she would make a better president than Trump.Getty Images"I assumed Trump would lose the election, and it would be all over then," saidYagihara, speaking from the factory in Saitama City, just north of Tokyo, wherethe masks are made.Many people purchasing the masks now are expected to wear them at year-endcompany parties, or 'bonenkai' (literally "forget-the-year party"), which areoften drunken affairs where junior employees have to dress up in some way.Ogawa Studios also makes Star Wars masks, with Darth Maul and Yoda at $35 (3,900) being the two biggest sellers. "With the Star Wars spin-off movie comingout in December, those masks are also doing well," said Yagihara.Interest in Ogawa Studios has also boosted sales of its masks of Japanese PrimeMinister Shinzo Abe.
