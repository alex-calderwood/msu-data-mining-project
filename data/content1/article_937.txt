During his campaign for the White House, President-elect Donald Trump promisedto eliminate regulations that target coal-fired power plants, one of the primarycauses of carbon emissions responsible for climate change.For Trump, a climate-change skeptic, getting rid of the Obama administration'sClean Power Plan, which would curb carbon emissions from power plants by 32percent by 2030, would give a boost to the declining U.S. coal industry and itsdecimated workforce across Appalachia.Even if the next president were to succeed, he would probably not reverse ayears-long movement away from coal in the U.S. electric power industry, thebiggest consumer of the black rock, according to the head of one of the nation'sleading electric utilities."If he were able to do that, I don't know really how much impact it would havebecause we're moving ahead and rebalancing our portfolio," Nick Akins, thepresident and CEO of American Electric Power, said recently."I think it's going to be very difficult for new coal-fired generation to getdeveloped," he said.Obama-era policies requiring reductions in emissions of carbon, mercury andother pollutants have contributed to coal's loss of market share in the powersector.Even more significant has been record U.S. production of cheap shale gas, thanksto hydraulic fracturing and other technologies, plus the slow but steadypenetration of wind and solar energy into power markets."It's a seven-year construction cycle for a coal unit, 15 years for a nuclearunit," Akins said in a phone call from AEP's Columbus, Ohio, headquarters. "Youcan develop a natural gas plant in two to three years, with a lot less risk forshareholders, and the price of natural gas as a fuel source is stillsubstantially low."And there are areas of the country that benefit from low-cost renewable fuels,particularly wind, and solar continues to come down as well, particularlyutility-scale solar. Those are areas that will continue to develop."For AEP, which has 5.4 million customers in 11 states, coal's share of thecompany's generating capacity has fallen from 71 percent in 2005 to about 47percent in 2017. Over that time, gas capacity has risen from 20 percent to 27percent, and renewable energy has jumped from 3 percent to 13 percent.
