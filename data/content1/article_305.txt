The Census Bureau says America has 325 million population, of whom 245 millionare voting-age adults. But only around two-thirds of those adults - somewherenear 160 million - are registered to vote.Although votes still aren't entirely counted for the 2016 presidential race,it's clear that Democrat Hillary Clinton won the popular vote, with more than 63million total, while Donald Trump got somewhere above 61 million.In other words, far fewer than half of America's registered voters - and onlyone-fourth of eligible adults - chose Trump.Can he claim a mandate to lead when only one-fourth of U.S. adults picked him?After Trump's victory, President Barack Obama remarked sourly: "It's a reminderthat elections matter and voting counts. I don't know how many times we have torelearn this lesson, because we ended up having 43 percent of the country notvoting who were eligible to vote."Around the world, many other democracies have much higher voter turnout - 91percent in Canada and Britain, 96 percent in Sweden and 99 percent in Japan.Among 35 top democracies, Pew Research says America ranks 31st in voting.If more Americans vote, the result better represents the population. Manysurveys have found that nonvoters generally hold progressive, humane,Democratic-type values - but they don't bother going to polls. In contrast,conservatives tend to be more determined voters.In some places, Republicans try to suppress voting - imposing legal obstacles onblacks, Hispanics, the young and others who lean Democratic. Perhaps thisaffected the outcome of some races in 2016, but not nearly as much as the numberof people who do not bother to vote.Come January, America will have a government of one-fourth of the people, byone-fourth of the people, for one-fourth of the people.
