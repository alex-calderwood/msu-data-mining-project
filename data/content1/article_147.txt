WASHINGTON (AP) -- President-elect Donald Trump said Wednesday he's leaving hisbusiness empire to focus on being the nation's 45th president, declaring he cansuccessfully avoid conflicts of interest between governing and profiting in theprivate sector."I will be leaving my great business in total in order to fully focus on runningthe country in order to make America great again," he tweeted in a series ofmissives sent before dawn. "While I am not mandated to do this under the law, Ifeel it is visually important, as president, to in no way have a conflict ofinterest with my various businesses."Trump did not provide any details about how he planned to separate from hisbusinesses, though he said legal documents were being prepared. He haspreviously said that he'd leave his business operations to his three eldestchildren -- Donald Jr., Eric and Ivanka.Ethics experts have pushed for Trump to fully exit the ownership of hisbusinesses using a blind trust or equivalent arrangement."Otherwise he will have a personal financial interest in his businesses thatwill sometimes conflict with the public interest and constantly raisequestions," Norman Eisen, President Barack Obama's chief ethics lawyer, andRichard Painter, who held the same post for President George W. Bush, said in ajoint statement Wednesday.Trump was also moving forward with his Cabinet selections, choosing formerGoldman Sachs executive Steven Mnuchin as treasury secretary and billionaireinvestor Wilbur Ross for commerce secretary.Mnuchin, 53, led Trump's finance operations during the presidential campaign.But he has no government experience, which could prove a political hurdle. Ifconfirmed by the Senate, Mnuchin would play a central role in shaping Trump'stax policies and infrastructure plans. He would also lead an agency tasked withimplementing international economic sanctions.Arriving at Trump Tower Wednesday morning for meetings, Mnuchin said theadministration planned "the most significant middle income tax cut sinceReagan." He also called for lowering corporate taxes to encourage companies tostay in the United States.Trump was accompanying his decision to line his Cabinet with financial industryinsiders with an announcement that the air conditioning giant Carrier Corp.planned to keep nearly 1,000 jobs in Indiana instead of moving them to Mexico.Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence, the outgoing Indiana governor,planned an event with Carrier officials Thursday to announce the plan.Details of the agreement were unclear. Trump spent much of his campaign pledgingto keep companies like Carrier from moving jobs overseas, relying on the skillshe used in business.Trump's sprawling business empire is unprecedented for a sitting president, asis the complexity and opaqueness of his financial holdings. He refused torelease his taxes during the campaign, citing an ongoing audit, and will beunder no legal obligation to do so in the White House.Trump owns golf clubs, office towers and other properties in several countries.He holds ownership stakes in more than 500 companies. He has struck licensingdeals for use of his name on hotels and other buildings around the world and hasbeen landing new business in the Middle East, India and South America.Reince Priebus, Trump's incoming White House chief of staff, was vague Wednesdayin describing how the president-elect planned to separate himself from hisbusinesses, saying "that'll all be worked out."Priebus told MSNBC's "Morning Joe," that Trump has "got the best people inAmerica working on it." Priebus demurred when asked if Trump planned to put hisbusinesses in a blind trust -- as presidents have traditionally done -- or leavethem in his children's hands."I'm not ready to reveal that really," Priebus said.Priebus added that Trump's business acumen and the many interests he has as aresult of it are "nothing to be ashamed about." He said the country hasn't seena president with such business holdings before and the rules and regulations"don't contemplate this scenario."------AP writers Julie Bykowicz and Catherine Lucey contributed to this report.------Follow Julie Pace at http://twitter.com/jpaceDC and Laurie Kellman athttp://twitter.com/APLaurieKellman
