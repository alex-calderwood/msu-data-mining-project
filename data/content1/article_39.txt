WASHINGTON - President-elect Donald Trump is tapping a trio of nominees withdeep ties to Washington and Wall Street to fill out his Cabinet, includingformer Goldman Sachs executive Steven Mnuchin as Treasury secretary.On Tuesday, Trump also chose Rep. Tom Price of Georgia to oversee the nation'shealth care system, picking the fierce Obamacare critic who has championedefforts to privatize Medicare. And he selected another veteran Republican,Elaine Chao, to lead the Department of Transportation.Mnuchin's official announcement was expected as early as Wednesday, according toa person familiar with the decision who insisted on anonymity in order toconfirm the pick ahead of time.Mnuchin, 53, led Trump's finance operations during the presidential campaign andbecome close with the president-elect and his family. But he has no governmentexperience, which could prove a hurdle in navigating the tricky politics ofWashington.Mnuchin would be the latest wealthy investor to join what is already shaping upto be an extraordinarily well-off Cabinet. Trump also is expected to nominateindustrialist billionaire Wilbur Ross to lead the Commerce Department. Michiganbillionaire Betsy DeVos was named as Trump's pick for education secretary lastweek.Mnuchin made his fortune on Wall Street, first at the New York investment bankGoldman Sachs and then as the head of his own private-equity fund. His closeties to an industry he would be in charge of regulating have the potential tocomplicate his confirmation and could undermine Trump's populist message.Price, picked to lead the Department of Health and Human Services after morethan a decade in Congress, helped craft House Speaker Paul Ryan's plan toprivatize Medicare - a position Trump opposed in the campaign. Chao, who was thefirst Asian-American woman to serve in a president's Cabinet - she served underGeorge W. Bush - is married to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who saidTuesday he would not recuse himself from her confirmation.Price's selection raised questions about the incoming president's commitment toMedicare, among other popular entitlement programs he repeatedly vowed topreserve before the election. The Georgia congressman led GOP efforts on CapitolHill to transform Medicare into a voucher-like system, a change that if enacted,would likely dramatically reduce government spending on the health care programthat serves an estimated 57 million people.Trump did not address Price's position on Medicare in a statement released byhis transition team. The team did not respond to subsequent questions about it."Chairman Price, a renowned physician, has earned a reputation for being atireless problem solver and the go-to expert on health care policy, making himthe ideal choice to serve in this capacity," Trump said. "He is exceptionallyqualified to shepherd our commitment to repeal and replace Obamacare and bringaffordable and accessible health care to every American."Trump, in a 2015 interview promoted on his campaign website, pledged not to cutexpensive entitlement programs that Republicans have fought for years to cut tohelp reduce the federal deficit."I'm not going to cut Social Security like every other Republican. And I'm notgoing to cut Medicare or Medicaid. Every other Republican's going to cut," Trumptold the Daily Signal.He later changed his mind on Medicaid, embracing the GOP concept of turning theprogram over to the states with a fixed amount of federal "block grant" funding.Like any Cabinet official, Price would carry out the wishes of the president.And a sweeping Medicare initiative would have to go through Congress with someDemocratic support, which would be unlikely.Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont charged that Price "has a long history of wantingto do exactly the opposite of what Trump campaigned on."Trump's team also announced that Seema Verma has been chosen to be administratorof the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.CHAO'S RECORDLike Price, Chao is well-known in Washington, having led the Department of Laborfor several years.Chao's record suggests she'd be skeptical of new safety regulations and mayattempt to roll back existing regulations. Under Chao, the Occupational Safetyand Health Administration didn't issue a single significant new safetyregulation for four years, and mine safety inspectors were cut and inspectionsreduced, said Thomas McGarity, a University of Texas law professor and author of"Freedom to Harm," a book about the labor department that includes Chao'stenure.Among the pressing issues facing the next transportation secretary will be howto boost the nation's aging infrastructure so that it can accommodate populationgrowth and not become a drag on the economy, modernizing the nation's airtraffic control system and ensuring that new transportation technologies areadopted in a safe manner.
