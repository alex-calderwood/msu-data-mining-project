SAM JANESCHSJANESCH@LNPNEWS.COMLancaster County certified its final election results with the state Wednesdayafter officials here rejected voters' petitions to recount nearly a dozenprecincts.The county Board of Elections, made up of the three county commissioners, saidthe 51 petitions they received from voters Monday needed to be filed in theCourt of Common Pleas, not the elections office, because the deadline hadpassed.The last-minute recount effort was pushed by Green Party presidential nomineeJill Stein to challenge President-elect Donald Trump's roughly 71,000-votemargin of victory over Hillary Clinton in Pennsylvania. Stein has argued thatirregularities may have played a role in Trump's surprise win.She filed a lawsuit on behalf of 100 voters in Commonwealth Court to request astatewide recount. She also encouraged individual voters to petition theircounty board of elections to order recounts of their individual precincts - aprocess that, in part, requires three voters from a precinct to file separatepetitions.Of the voters who filed them Monday, 11 of 240 county precincts had at leastthree voters file petitions, and therefore would have been potentially eligiblefor a recount.Still, the passed deadline made the county unable to even consider thepetitions, the board argued.Assistant County Solicitor Mel Newcomer said because the county alreadycompleted its final computation of election results -which it did Nov. 23 afterweeks of counting all absentee, military, provisional and write-in ballots - itwould be unable to consider the recount petitions.Newcomer said Pennsylvania Department of State, which oversees elections,informed them the petitions would instead need to be filed in court.The final countThe certified results will show Trump winning the county with 137,914 voteswhile Clinton garnered 91,093 votes.County Commissioner Craig Lehman, a Democrat, said he has such confidence in thecounty's elections that if they were the proper venue to consider the recountpetitions, he would be in favor of ordering them just to show the system isfair."There are folks out there who are stirring the pot, who are really underminingour election system in a way that is unhealthy for this country," Lehman said.Republican Commissioner Josh Parsons called the petitions - all of which weredownloaded from Jill Stein's website and include the same argument about hackingfrom a Michigan State University professor - "frivolous and franklyinappropriate" because they don't allege problems specifically occurred here.Commissioner Dennis Stuckey, also a Republican, agreed. He said he was concernedthis was an organized effort, using an argument that voting machines could behacked, even though none of the county machines are connected to the internet.To be hacked, they would need to be manually tampered with.
