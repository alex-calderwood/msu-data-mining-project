HIGHLIGHT:Â Donald Trump's lawyers say they would have won the cases if they hadgone to trial.Gregory Bull/APWASHINGTON - President-elect Donald Trump, who has repeatedly bragged he neversettles lawsuits despite a long history of doing so, has agreed to a $25 millionsettlement to end the fraud cases pending against his defunct real estateseminar program, Trump University, according to New York Attorney General EricSchneiderman.Schneiderman said in a Friday statement that the settlement includes a $1million penalty paid to New York state for violating the state's  laws bycalling the program a "university" despite offering no degrees or traditionaleducation.Schneiderman said his office had sued Trump for "swindling thousands of innocentAmericans out of millions of dollars" and that the settlement had come despiteresistance from Trump."Today, that all changes. Today's $25 million settlement agreement is a stunningreversal by Donald Trump and a major victory for the over 6,000 victims of hisfraudulent university," he said.Trump's lawyers  say the settlement will allow  him to devote  full attention tothe challenges facing the nation. The lawyers said they have no doubt TrumpUniversity would have won the cases if they had gone to trial. The deal doesn'trequire Trump to acknowledge wrongdoing.The settlement eliminates the possibility that Trump will be called to testifyin court in the midst of his presidential transition. The deal ends threelawsuits against him, including a California class-action case that wasscheduled to go to trial Nov. 28, as well as a second lawsuit in that state andthe New York state action.Negotiations over the Trump University deal were handled in part by lawyers forSchneiderman, a Democrat, who had filed suit against Trump University in 2013.Schneiderman has called the real estate program "a fraud from beginning to end."The fates of the New York case and the two California suits are linked becausethey were all brought on behalf of an overlapping pool of former TrumpUniversity customers, said the person familiar with the situation, who spoke oncondition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the ongoing negotiations.Trump is known for aggressively pursuing his business interests in court. Still,he has settled lawsuits many times, despite arguing that doing so only invitesfurther litigation.The Trump University case emerged as a political issue during the presidentialcampaign.As he rose in the polls, won primaries and emerged as the Republican nominee,Trump at times seemed engrossed in the litigation and repeatedly defended thebusiness from the stump.At a rally in San Diego in May, Trump dissected the matter at length, insistingthat most customers who had spent money on the real estate program had beenpleased.Trump's San Diego statements included an attack on Federal District Court JudgeGonzalo Curiel, who was overseeing the California cases.In subsequent interviews in June, Trump continued to press complaints againstCuriel, alleging that the Indiana-born judge was biased because of his Mexicanheritage.Curiel had urged a settlement in the cases pending in his courtroom, whereTrump's lawyers had recently asked for a delay, citing the burdens of thepresidential transition.Curiel said the agreement - $21 million for two San Diego cases and $4 millionfor a New York case - is subject to his approval.Plaintiffs' attorney Jason Forge, who confirmed the deal, said participants inthe class-action litigation will get at least half of their money back and somewill get it all.Associated Press contributed.
