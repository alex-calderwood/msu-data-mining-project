Rowling rollin': J.K. Rowling's magic touch has come up a tad short on USATODAY's Best-Selling Books list. The author's  Fantastic Beasts and Where toFind Them: The Original Screenplay lands at No. 3. The Fantastic Beasts movie, aHarry Potter spinoff, raked in $75 million its opening weekend. Rowling'sscreenplay about magizoologist Newt Scamander, her first, went on sale  Nov. 18,the same day the movie was released, so USA TODAY's list tracks three days ofsales (Friday-Sunday). Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, the play script,landed at No. 1  on Aug. 4 and spent six straight weeks in the top spot. It hitNo. 1 with just one day's worth of sales tabulated.On the trail: In the wake of the presidential election, two new politicallythemed books have emerged as winners. Readers cast their votes for Settle forMore by Megyn Kelly of Fox News and Our Revolution by Vermont Sen. BernieSanders. Kelly's memoir lands at No. 5, while Sanders comes in at No. 12. Bothauthors have made major media and bookstore appearances. Kelly became part ofthe news cycle during what she calls her "Year of Trump." Sanders, who lost theDemocratic presidential nomination to Hillary Clinton, obviously still has lotsof fans who are feeling the Bern and buying his book, in which he recounts hismonths on the campaign trail and lays out his vision for a "politicalrevolution."
