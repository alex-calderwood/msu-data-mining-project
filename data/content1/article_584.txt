And we thought Donald Trump might not accept the presidential results. Funny howthe tables have turned, now that progressives are faced with this unanticipatedoutcome.We'll give credit to Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party establishment.They've urged supporters to accept Trump's electoral vote victory, even thoughher lead in the popular vote continues to grow, now approaching 2 million.But certain parties just won't let go, like Green Party candidate Jill Stein.The Lexington resident, whose candidacy probably helped derail Clinton's, nowhas mounted a recount crusade in the three key states that barely broke for theRepublican president-elect -- Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.Trump eked out his closest margin of victory in Michigan. On Wednesday thesecretary of state there officially accepted the certified recount results fromall its counties, which gave Trump an adjusted 10,704-vote margin of victory.However, Stein targeted Wisconsin for the initial recount challenge. She managedto quickly raise nearly $5 million for that effort -- far more than she couldever attract to her own campaign. Stein beat the Friday recount deadline.Supposedly Stein was moved to act due to alleged reports of Internet hackinginto the results in those three states, claims that have since been discountedor dismissed, even by the New York Times.Undeterred, Stein apparently intends -- fundraising permitting -- to purserecounts in all three states.For the record, Trump enjoys about a 27,000-vote margin in Wisconsin and anearly 70,000-vote cushion in Pennsylvania.Without Michigan's 16 electoral votes, Trump still totals 290 -- 20 more than heneeds.And of course we have other progressive wingnuts pressuring Republican electorsto switch their allegiance to Clinton when they officially meet in December toselect the vice president and president.By tradition, electors are pledged to the candidate that won that particularstate. According to a U.S. House of Representatives' website, defections almostnever occur -- and no more than one in any election.Even in the hotly "hanging chad" 2000 presidential election, when it took theSupreme Court to finally declare George W. Bush the winner over Al Gore,electors voted the party line, except for one who submitted a blank ballot.It's time for Jill Stein to put her conspiracy theories aside and join theoverwhelming majority in this country, which seek to turn the page and move onwith the seamless transition of presidential succession.Our nation deserves precedence over political agendas.
