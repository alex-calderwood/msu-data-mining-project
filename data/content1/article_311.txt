As Republican congressional leaders and president-elect Donald Trump areconsidering the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, Sylvia Burwell is trying toshow people the benefits of President Barack Obama's signature health care law.The U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services and West Virginia native was inCharleston Tuesday to kick off a public relations campaign to show why thefederal law is important and highlight the number of people benefiting from it."This isn't a conversation about a word - Obamacare. It's actually about realpeople's lives, Burwell said. "We need to have those stories told, and that'swhat we are starting here today - no better place than West Virginia.The effort to defend the law comes at a time when insurance premiums in publicmarketplaces are expected to increase and some of the nation's top insurers aredropping out of the state and federal exchanges that were set up after the lawwas passed in 2010.The comprehensive health care law has been a primary target of Republicans foryears and played heavily in the presidential election, as Trump called for itsrepeal and Hillary Clinton suggested it could be reformed.Burwell laid out some of the successes of the health care law, including reducedMedicare prescription costs, a ban on insurance companies turning down peoplewith pre-existing conditions and ending limits on the amount of treatmentsomeone can have over the course of their lifetime.She also cited the portions of the law that block additional costs forcontraception, limiting out-of-pocket spending under insurance plans anddecreasing the number of uninsured adults nationwide from 18 percent to 11percent.In West Virginia, hundreds of thousands of people in the state have healthinsurance for the first time, including more than 178,000 people who havequalified for coverage under the expanded Medicaid program.Since Trump won the election, he has softened his campaign rhetoric andsuggested he will keep parts of the law, including the mandate on pre-existingconditions.Burwell is taking Trump and other opponents of the law at their word when theysay they will keep many of the most popular portions of the law, but shequestions whether those pieces can work if the rest of the law is dismantled."This is like Jenga, Burwell said. "That is a lot of what the Affordable CareAct is. It's like Jenga, where you can maybe move a piece, but when you pull outa key piece, the whole thing is going to tumble.One of the reasons insurance companies relented to covering people withpre-existing conditions was because lawmakers also put in the requirement thateveryone had to purchase either public, private or employer-based coverage. Thatcompromise is likely to fall apart if the insurance mandate is removed.To show how the health care changes under Obamacare have helped, Burwell wasjoined on a panel Tuesday by individuals who have benefited for various portionsof the law.Allen Kennedy, who is self employed, didn't have insurance for years, butdecided he needed it now that he was getting older.He is now one of the thousands of West Virginians who found out they werecovered under West Virginia's Medicaid expansion. It has allowed him to havesurgery on his eyes to remove cataracts that would have stopped him fromworking, he said.Kelly Allen, a Morgantown resident and health care employee with West VirginiaUniversity, currently can't be denied insurance because of her immunodeficiencydisorder, but she fears that could change.When she was still on her mother's insurance, they often got calls threateningto drop her coverage because of her health condition. Her mother kept anattorney on speed dial, she said."I knew if I ever had a lapse in my coverage or if I ever hit a lifetime limit,I would essentially be uninsurable for the rest of my life, Allen said. "So theAffordable Care Act affects me very much."I don't want to go back to the way life was before the Affordable Care Act, shesaid.Members of the Obama administration, including Burwell, have recognized thefailings of some aspects of the law, including the lack of competition that is aresult of major insurers dropping out of the marketplaces.In the past year, major national insurance providers, like Aetna, have pulledout of numerous states, and in late October, the Department of Health and HumanServices released a report that showed that the average premium for a mid-levelplan in the market was expected to increase by 25 percent next year.That number immediately caught fire on the campaign trail as Trump andcongressional Republicans held it up as evidence of the law's failure.That report, however, did also show that 77 percent of the people enrolled inthe individual insurance plans were paying less than $100 per month due tosubsidies offered through federal tax credits.Still, other people with higher incomes shopping on exchanges don't alwaysqualify for those subsidies.Obama authored a policy paper in The Journal of the American Medical Associationin July that laid out some changes that he believes could improve the system.The outgoing president called for the remaining 19 states to expand theirMedicaid programs, for additional insurance subsidies in the state and federalmarketplaces, for policies to rein in prescription drug costs that haveincreased dramatically in recent years and a Medicaid-like public insuranceoption for states that have limited competition among private insurers.That last part was considered in 2010, but was dropped out of the final law.Obama laid some of the blame for problems with the system at the feet of healthcare lobbying groups that have sought to stymie change."Special interests pose a continued obstacle to change, Obama wrote in thepolicy paper. "We worked successfully with some health care organizations andgroups, such as major hospital associations, to redirect excessive Medicarepayments to federal subsidies for the uninsured. Yet others, like thepharmaceutical industry, oppose any change to drug pricing, no matter howjustifiable and modest, because they believe it threatens their profits.Burwell was also joined Tuesday by health professionals that have seen adramatic drop in uncompensated care at hospitals, which ultimately saves thosehealth care organizations money.Rocco Massey, another panelist, works as the Community CEO at AppalachianRegional Hospital in Beckley, which, like other hospitals throughout the state,has seen millions of dollars in cost savings due to more people being insured."At our organization, 100 percent of that money is plowed back into ourcommunity, Massey said. "It all comes back. It comes back in the form of newservices. It comes back in the form of new equipment, new buildings. It helps usrecruit new physicians back to West Virginia, and it helps us retain nurses.Fewer people are using the emergency room as their only form of care, he said.Instead, they are visiting the hospital's community clinic more regularly forroutine and preventative care.Margaret Grassie, a Charleston resident, was one of those people using theemergency room as her doctor's office.As an employee of a small business, she didn't have insurance before shequalified under the Medicaid expansion. Now, she has been able to afford herdaily medication, treatment on her ankle and a monitor for her diabetes."Basically, I fell through the cracks, Grassie said. "And the elevator thatbrought me up was the Affordable Care Act.SAM OWENS | Gazette-MailSylvia M.
