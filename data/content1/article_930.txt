HIGHLIGHT:Â SakranJoseph Sakran remembers the day in 1994 when an errant bullet changed thetrajectory of his life.Then a senior at Lake Braddock Secondary School in Burke, Va., he remembers theflash from the gun fired during a fight after a football game, people dispersingand blood gushing over his clothes. He had been shot in the throat.Over the next six months, Sakran had a tracheostomy and underwent multiplesurgeries to help him breathe and speak. The 17-year-old also resolved to becomea physician. He believed his destiny was "to give others that second chance I'vebeen given."Now 39 and a trauma surgeon at Johns Hopkins Hospital, Sakran is on theforefront of a movement among medical professionals growing more vocal about asurge in gun violence in Baltimore, a city where more than 240 people have beenshot to death this year, and across the country. His medical advocacy group isjoining forces with another physicians organization, and he hopes to launch morein-depth research into shootings and victim outcomes.Sakran says he is motivated by his experience as a survivor and his experienceperforming emergency surgeries on gunshot victims. He said he recalls the lookson his parents' faces two decades ago when talking to the parents of shootingvictims he is trying to save."Their faces are chiseled in my mind," he said. "I imagine what they had beengoing through - and not always does someone survive."In Baltimore, one out of three people shot last year died, making the city oneof the most lethal of America's largest cities, according to a yearlongBaltimore Sun investigation. The odds for gunshot victims worsened last year inat least 10 of those cities, including Baltimore, Chicago and Milwaukee, The Sunfound.While medical advances and practices have dramatically improved the survivalrate of most trauma patients, studies by hospitals including Johns Hopkins haveshown the chances of survival for gunshot victims have decreased. At the sametime, a number of deadly trends have taken root, such as criminals usinghigher-caliber guns with large-capacity magazines, leaving multiple-gunshotvictims to bleed out more quickly.Political impasses over universal background checks for gun purchasers andincreasing federal funding for gun violence research was among the reasonsSakran started the group Doctors for Hillary two years ago. The group supportedDemocratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, who made gun control a centraltenet of her campaign. Sakran said his group includes a few hundred core membersand 65,000 followers on Facebook.In the wake of Donald Trump's win over Clinton, Sakran plans to merge his groupwith Doctors for America, a political advocacy group of health professionalsthat pushed for health care reform and has made increased federal funding forgun violence research a top goal.Sakran hopes to continue pushing for universal background checks, closingloopholes that allow customers at gun shows to bypass background checks,preventing "straw" purchasers from legally buying guns for people with criminalrecords, and greater restrictions on "military-style weapons.""More than ever it's going to be important for us to really take a concertedeffort to say that this is not a Democratic issue, not a Republican issue. Thisis an American issue," he said.Trump has opposed limits on gun ownership, and any gun-control measure is likelyto meet stiff resistance in a Republican-controlled Congress. Trump, aRepublican, has said he would appoint Supreme Court justices who uphold theconstitutional right to bear arms and that he would seek to expand mental healthtreatment programs in the wake of mass shootings by mentally ill people inrecent years.Doctors for America Executive Director Alice Chen, an internal medicinephysician and assistant professor at George Washington University and the DavidGeffen School of Medicine at UCLA, said common ground can be found on issuessuch as preventing suicides and child injuries by firearms."All of us have a responsibility to be more civically engaged," Chen said."Certainly we have to think about what are the likeliest things that we can getpassed in the new political environment. ... But the urgency to do somethingdoes not change."Sakran said seeking reforms on a state-by-state basis may be another route fordoctors to pursue.While Maryland already has some of the strictest gun laws in the nation,Baltimore Police Commissioner Kevin Davis plans to step up efforts to lobbylawmakers in the General Assembly session that begins in January for mandatoryprison time for people arrested with illegal handguns and high-capacity gunmagazines. Other proposals legislators plan to push include bills to ban gunsfrom college campuses and prevent people on federal terrorist watch lists frombuying them.S. Rob Todd, chief of general surgery at Ben Taub Hospital in Houston and amember of Sakran's group, said surgeons need to continue to make the public andpoliticians aware of the worsening conditions in which many gunshot victimsarrive at hospitals. Todd, also a professor at the Baylor College of Medicine,said the percentage of gunshot victims dying in the emergency room has increasedsignificantly since 2000."At some point, we have to stop being quiet and we have to start speaking up,"he said. "We can talk about the gravity of the situation. We can talk about whatwe see."Sakran said he also wants to study the degree to which gun violence has becomemore intense nationally using data from medical examiners' records and theNational Trauma Data Bank, which gathers statistics from hospitals.He also wants to study Johns Hopkins patients who have been shot on more thanone occasion to determine factors that put people at a greater risk of beingvictimized.Sakran has vivid memories of his own shooting. He remembers turning his headtoward two people who were arguing when someone fired a .38-caliber gun into thecrowd of high-schoolers, striking him and another student, who also survived. Heremembers choking on his blood as paramedics tried to place him flat in amedevac, and a trauma surgeon taking charge amid chaos, wheeling him into anoperating room.Sakran's trachea was ruptured and his left carotid artery, which provides bloodflow to his brain, was severed. One of his vocal cords was paralyzed, as was aphrenic nerve, which helps with speaking and breathing.Sakran underwent multiple operations at Inova Fairfax Hospital, where he wasborn and, years later, where he would do his residency.In a permanent, slightly hoarse tone with a volume about half of what it shouldbe, Sakran speaks admiringly about the trauma surgeon and vascular surgeon whosaved his life and taught him as a young resident."I was really inspired to give others the opportunity I had been given," hesaid.The bullet that struck Sakran was surgically removed weeks later. He keeps it ina container on his dresser, and takes it out to examine every once in a while asa reminder of his near-fatal shooting and his mission to save others.jgeorge@baltsun.comtwitter.com/justingeorge
