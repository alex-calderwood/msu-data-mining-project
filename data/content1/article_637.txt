They have just lost to the most unpopular presidential candidate inrecent memory. Lockstep media support and a much larger war chest were notenough to save them from losing not only the presidency, but also in state racesacross the country.Since President Obama's first election, Democrats have lost control of the Houseand Senate, as well as a dozen governors' houses and roughly 900 statelegislative seats. Republicans have control of all levels of government in 24states, while Democrats have total control over six. Overall, the party seemsincapable of reaching out to the middle part of the country, white andmiddle-class voters.This contrasts with the 1990s, when a group of party activists consciouslyrebuilt the party to appeal to middle-class Americans. Groups like theDemocratic Leadership Council - for whose think tank, the Progressive PolicyInstitute, I worked for several years - pushed notions of personalresponsibility, welfare reform, tough crime policies and economic growth that,embraced by Bill Clinton, expanded the party's base in the Midwest, theAppalachians and even the Southeast.Leftward Ho!Such a shift to the middle is unlikely today. Progressives generally see HillaryClinton's loss as largely a rejection of her husband's neoliberal policies andwant to push the party further to the left.This parallels developments in the United Kingdom, where, following their defeatin 2015, the Labour Party promoted a far-left figure, Jeremy Corbyn, as its leader. This wasdriven by grassroots progressives - deeply green, multiculturalist and openlysocialist. Many, including several high up in Labour's parliamentary party,believe the party has little chance to win under such leadership.Democrats face a similar dilemma. Driven by their dominant academic and media"thought police," any shift to the middle on issues like crime, climate changeor regulation now seems unimaginable. Self-described progressives who nowdominate the party generally adhere to a series of policies - from open bordersto draconian climate change policies - that are unlikely to play well outsidethe coastal enclaves.Some of the criticism of Clintonian neoliberalism is somewhat justified. As theemergence of both Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump suggests, support forglobalization and free trade has weakened in both parties. This reflects thefact that economic gains have become increasingly concentrated since Clintonleft office, and even under the progressive hero, Barack Obama. It's hard toargue, as the DLC did 25 years ago, for a more market-based system when the vastmajority fail to benefit while the upper echelons do much better.So it is no surprise, then, that the hyperregulatory and redistributionistagendas epitomized by Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders are nowascendant. This pattern is exacerbated by the party's increasing indifference toeconomic growth, in large part, due to their embrace of draconian climate changepolicies. Climate change policies, as now constituted, tend to suppresshigher-wage, blue-collar employment. If you give up on growth to save theplanet, the only real solution remaining is massive redistribution, including aweb of subsidies to make up for the lack of income growth, affordable housingand economic opportunity.The multiculti trapThe Corbynization of the Democratic Party also turns on militantmulticulturalism. This agenda is shaped, as in Britain, by a disjointed concertof grievance groups, ranging from gender activists to those who claim torepresent Latinos, African Americans, Asians, Muslims and others, whosealienation has been exacerbated by Trump's triumph. Trump's nationalist rhetoricis particularly disliked by progressives who, as author and New America fellowMichael Lind notes in a recent National Review column, find the very idea ofborders and national interests reactionary and inherently racist.This identity politics, some liberals note, has driven many whites into adefensive crouch and pushed them toward the Republicans. Yet, there is littlesign that the party will move in their direction. After all, Hillary labeledthem "deplorables" - not much of a sales pitch. After the election, progressivejournalists have portrayed Trump voters as irredeemably racist, misogynist,stupid and even too "fat." Summing up, suggests Slate's Jamelle Bouie, there'sno such thing as a "good Trump voter."Inside the progressive echo chamber, many still believe that an alliance ofminorities, gender activists and millennials will make their victory inevitable.This can be seen in the tendency of Democrats, just as there is a palpable risein crime, to invite the militant Black Lives Matter movement into their tent.Perhaps nothing more illustrates the Corbynite trend than the proposal to makeMinnesota Rep. Keith Ellison chairman of the Democratic National Committee.Ellison does check off the diversity boxes, but also would place in partyleadership someone who has embraced the Nation of Islam, supports the boycott ofIsraeli products and has compared 9-11 to the Reichstag fire that facilitatedthe Nazi dictatorship.Going left may be emotionally satisfying to Democrats who feel abandoned bytheir less progressive fellow citizens. But abandoning the middle of thespectrum does not seem an effective way to get back into power.Joel Kotkin is the R.C.
