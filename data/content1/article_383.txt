ZuckerbergFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg shared his plan of attack against phony newsstories on the social media platform, following up an announcement about work"to flag fake news and hoaxes" after a vicious presidential election.In a new post, Zuckerberg said Facebook previously relied on users to determinewhich stories were accurate, and said the company still believes in "erring onthe side of letting people share what they want whenev-While the CEO made itclear Facebook will continue to "rely on our community and trusted thirdparties," he knows "people want accurate information." So, the company plans tomake some changes.Zuckerberg didn't share a timeline for implementation or promise the projectswould correct the problem. "Some of these ideas will work well, and some willnot," he wrote. But, he did say Facebook is "committed to getting this right."Some have said fake news stories influenced voters to back Republican DonaldTrump, but Zuckerberg said it was "extremely unlikely" that phony stories on thesocial network affected the outcome.Nearly half of Americans get their news from Facebook, according to the PewResearch Center. Just two in 10 U.S. adults get news from print newspapers.As its dominance has grown, Facebook has resisted claims it's a de facto newspublisher, exercising editorial judgment with the power to sway billions ofminds.But President Obama cited Facebook's influence at a pre-election Michigan rallyfor Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton."And people, if they just repeat attacks enough, and outright lies over and overagain, as long as it's on Facebook and people can see it, as long as it's onsocial media, people start believing it. And it creates this dust cloud ofnonsense," he said.Contributing: Kevin McCoy
