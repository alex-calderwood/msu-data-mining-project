The alt-right isn't just a U.S. phenomenon. Worldwide, upstart online sitesmodeled on the Breitbart News strategy of current affairs and commentary posts,conspiracy theories and click-bait headlines have made inroads, riding a wave ofnationalist and anti-globalization sentiment and benefiting from the increasingimportance of social media."My sense is [these sites] are not getting a huge amount of traction at themoment, because national news media tends to be stronger in countries [outsidethe U.S.] and social media use is lower," says Nic Newman from the ReutersInstitute for the Study of Journalism in London. "But it's rising fast. In theU.K., we found among 18-24 year-olds, around a quarter use social media as theirprimary source of news. A few years ago, it was around 1 percent-2 percent. Andsocial media use fuels these sites, giving visibility to more extreme, ferociousviews."Donald Trump's victory in the U.S. presidential election and the appointment offormer Breitbart CEO Stephen Bannon as chief strategist for the newadministration has given heart to these sites - from Brazil, to Germany, Japanto Canada (yes, even Canada) - to up their rhetoric and push for a Trump-likeuprising at home.Oh and Breitbart itself, which has already launched outlets in Israel and theU.K., has announced plans to roll out in both France and Germany ahead ofelections in those two countries in 2017.Read more: Inside the "War Room" as Breitbart CEO Claims "Smear Campaign FromMainstream"Here is THR's look at Breitbart or similar operations in various countries:France Fdesouche.com, SOS Racisme Anti-WhiteFdesouche.comis the cornerstone ofthe French alt-right, aggregating stories about immigration, Islam and crime."16 Gypsies Rob Tourists at the Eiffel Tower" is a typical headline.The site is generally tamer than Breitbart but serves as the public face for awide spectrum of more extreme French alt-right outlets, includingBrujitafr.fr(sample headline: "President Obama to unleash devastating solarstorm before Trump takes office") and popular Facebook site SOS RacismeAnti-White, which recently posted a meme of mugshots of Islamic terrorists withthe headline: "Juppe's government cabinet 2017," referring to the centristconservative politician Alain Juppe, one of the candidates for the Frenchpresidency in next year's elections.In Paris, the government has been proactive in combating these and otherconspiracy theory sites, launching its own website on how to detect and dissectfake news.U.K.Breitbart LondonAlt-right sites have had a tough time gaining traction inthe Britain, in part because the country's notorious tabloids already occupymuch of the same space (a columnist for top tab The Daily Mail, for example,advocated for gun boats to shoot refugees trying to flee across theMediterranean to Europe).But a British version of Breitbart, launched in 2015, has seen readership jump135 percent year-over-year and boasted 15 million page views in July, giving ita bigger reach than Vice Media in the U.K. There are also political ties:Breitbart London's Editor-in-Chief Raheem Kassam is a former adviser to NigelFarage, the face of the Brexit campaign and an adviser on Trump's campaign.GermanyPolitically IncorrectFounded by German teacher Stefan Herre in 2004 tocombat "anti-Americanism" following the re-election of George W.

GeenStijl is infamous for using a variety ofterms, many invented by editors and readers, to refer to immigrants.JapanHoshu-SokuhoThe Hoshu-Sokuho("Conservative Bulletin") website acts as themouthpiece for the country's Net-uyoku ("Internet-Right"), a small but vocalultra-nationalist minority whose main preoccupations include the evils of China,South Korea and domestic liberals.Among its recent articles was a report claiming that Fuji TV - part of thecountry's largest conservative broadcast and print media group - has beeninfiltrated by Koreans who are inserting subliminal anti-Japanese messages inits programs.
