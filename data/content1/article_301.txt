Mayor Danny Jones says Charleston won't protect undocumented immigrants fromdeportation under the Donald Trump administration.He said there have been no previous efforts and he doesn't plan in the future toturn Charleston into a "sanctuary city."Sanctuary cities offer protection to people who are in the country illegally."We don't want to pick that kind of fight, especially with this administration,"Jones said Thursday.While there is no universally accepted definition for a sanctuary city, theImmigrant Legal Resource Center, which provides legal training and advocates forthe rights of immigrants, defines them as jurisdictions where police forcesdon't comply with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's direction to detainundocumented immigrants and turn them over to immigration enforcement officials.In June, after 45 years as a Republican, Jones left the party, saying that, forthe first time in his life, he could not support the party's candidate forpresident.President-elect Trump has vowed to deport millions of immigrants in the countryillegally. During his campaign, he also said he would withdraw federal fundsfrom sanctuary cities.Since the election, several major cities have vowed they will continue to upholdtheir sanctuary status. In New York City, Mayor Bill De Blasio has said hereminded Trump, who repeatedly proposed a ban on Muslim immigrants, that 900 NewYork City police officers are Muslim.The Gazette-Mail ran a story Wednesday about a rally in support of turningCharleston into a "resettlement community." That effort referred to refugeeslegally placed here, while sanctuary cities, in contrast, benefit a separategroup of people, undocumented immigrants. Several of the organizers working tobring refugees to Charleston said they had no comment on Jones' remarks, sayingthey are focused on refugees legally placed here, versus immigrants who are nothere legally.Jones said the city has no plans to become a sanctuary city "because we obeyfederal law and, even though I believe - I'm sure - there are undocumented folksthat are here, we're not going to sanction it."He also said he believes that major cities that have spoken out are jeopardizingfederal funding."We're not on the radar screen, number one, to be a sanctuary city," he said."We're not a big urban area. We're not near the border."Kemi Bello, spokeswoman for the Immigrant Legal Resource Center, said the centertracks jurisdictions that don't comply with ICE detainers, which have been ruledunconstitutional by multiple federal courts across the country, and are aware offive statewide laws or policies, 365 county policies or ordinances, and about 37city-level policies.She noted that the term also has been used for jurisdictions with policies thatguide against inquiring into immigration status, offer city services withoutrespect to immigration status or decline to spend local resources assisting withimmigration enforcement."We think it's safe to say that cutting federal funding from all those placeswould have a very large effect, with potentially drastic consequences to civilsociety, should so many hundreds of communities have local public safety budgetsslashed, she said. "But it's not clear to me how the next administration woulddefine sanctuary,' nor whether their actions towards these cities/counties wouldbe legal."Policymakers in many of these jurisdictions may understandably be concernedthat the next administration may try to coerce them into spending their ownresources on federal immigration enforcement instead of prioritizing their ownlocal responsibilities. There's simultaneously a danger of blurring the linebetween local and federal law enforcement such that immigrant communities willrefuse to engage with local police or authorities in ways that will reducepublic safety for everyone.She said the center regularly advises law enforcement on the legal problems withICE detainers, and they have seen success in communities that don't comply withthe detainers."Their children are less likely to live in fear of losing a parent because of atraffic stop, she said.Adrian Smith, a spokesman for ICE in the Philadelphia field office, said theDepartment of Homeland Security's current approach "focuses enforcementresources on convicted criminals and individuals who threaten public safety andnational security, while also taking into account important community policingneeds."With the implementation of the Priority Enforcement Program in July 2015, manylaw enforcement agencies, including some large jurisdictions, are now once againcooperating with ICE, he said.The ICE website states that immigration officials now focus on "targetingindividuals convicted of significant criminal offenses or who otherwise pose athreat to public safety.Prior to July 2015, ICE would issue detainers when "an immigration officer hadreason to believe the individual was removable, the website states.Reach Erin Beck at erin.beck@wvgazettemail.com, 304-348-5163,acebook.com/erinbeckwv or follow @erinbeckwv on Twitter.
