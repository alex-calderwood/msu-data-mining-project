Excerpts from a statement posted on Medium by Clinton campaign lawyer MarkElias:Over the last few days, officials in the Clinton campaign have received hundredsof messages, emails, and calls urging us to do something, anything, toinvestigate claims that the election results were hacked and altered in a way todisadvantage Secretary Clinton.The concerns have arisen, in particular, with respect to Michigan, Wisconsin andPennsylvania  --  three states that together proved decisive in thispresidential election and where the combined margin of victory for Donald Trumpwas merely 107,000 votes.We certainly understand the heartbreak felt by so many who worked so hard toelect Hillary Clinton, and it is a fundamental principle of our democracy toensure that every vote is properly counted.Moreover, this election cycle was unique in the degree of foreign interferencewitnessed throughout the campaign: the U.S. government concluded that Russianstate actors were behind the hacks of the Democratic National Committee and thepersonal email accounts of Hillary for America campaign officials.For all these reasons, we have quietly taken a number of steps in the last twoweeks to rule in or out any possibility of outside interference in the votetally in these critical battleground states.Because we had not uncovered any actionable evidence of hacking or outsideattempts to alter the voting technology, we had not planned to exercise this(recount) option ourselves, but now that a recount has been initiated inWisconsin, we intend to participate in order to ensure the process proceeds in amanner that is fair to all sides. If Jill Stein follows through as she haspromised and pursues recounts in Pennsylvania and Michigan, we will take thesame approach in those states as well.We do so fully aware that the number of votes separating Donald Trump andHillary Clinton in the closest of these states  --  Michigan  --  well exceedsthe largest margin ever overcome in a recount. But regardless of the potentialto change the outcome in any of the states, we feel it is important, onprinciple, to ensure our campaign is legally represented in any courtproceedings and represented on the ground in order to monitor the recountprocess itself.
