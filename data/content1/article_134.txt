ACTIONS SPEAK LOUDER: So this is how the "tolerant" liberals react to losing anelection. Riots. Mayhem. Assaults. Violence. And to think they could have beenin power. How ironic that the very thing they accuse conservatives of being theyseem to embrace and act out. Who are the real fascists now?DunstableNATURAL HIGH: I find it incredible that The Sun has included opioid overdosedeaths in the same editorial as recreational marijuana. Heroin is an illegallyproduced highly concentrated drug with a potency unknown to the user until theyconsume it. Marijuana is a natural herb consumed just as it comes from theplant. No one has ever died from an overdose of marijuana.There is no comparisonbetween heroin and marijuana and it is irresponsible of The Sun to do so. Thepeople got this one right. Long live democracy!ChelmsfordWILLING DONOR: During the presidential campaign I was deluged with requests formoney for various candidates. Now that the election is over, where can I donatemoney to help the Hollywood stars make their moves to Canada and Australiaeasier? Also, I would be interested in helping the folks in the state ofCalifornia to officially become a part of Mexico.DracutWARPED REALITY: How desperate can a guy be who'd blow himself up for a fewvirgins in paradise? Or are they really drugged, shamed or coerced in some way?Christian martyrs took their own life when forced to; what's propelling thisendless supply of eager suiciders?LowellDO YOUR JOB: Sen. Elizabeth Warren supported Hillary Clinton and she's a loser;Warren is a loser too. She should start working for us.DracutLEFT EXAMINATION: The liberal media bear a lot of responsibility in the wayTrump was depicted. The collective media need to take a hard look at themselves.Pelham, N.H.
