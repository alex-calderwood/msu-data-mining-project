Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein has raised millions of dollars toseek recounts of election results in three states.Election lawyers Gary Gordon (left) and John Pirich testify against a proposedrecount as members of the Michigan Board of Canvassers meet.Supporters of President-elect Donald Trump took legal action in three stateslate Thursday and Friday to stop candidate-initiated recounts, including inWisconsin, where the state has started verifying the results of the Nov. 8presidential election.Donors have poured more than $6.8 million into a fund that they hope will resultin recounts in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania. But experts say the chancesare practically nil that recounts in the three states - even if they happen -would give the presidency to Democrat Hillary Clinton.She lost to Trump by a combined 104,175 votes in those states, and would need toreverse the outcome in all three to secure the presidency."The chance of a change of results in all three, which would be a change in theresults of the presidential election, is precisely zero," said Dan Tokaji, a lawprofessor at the Ohio State University Moritz College of Law. "I think the bestadvice for the public watching all this is 'take a deep breath.'"But there is more at stake than just the outcome of the election, said PaulLeonard, a political science instructor at Wright State University and a formerDayton mayor.If the recounts reveal substantial vote tampering, voting machine malfunctions,miscounts or other Election Day mischief, there could be nationwideramifications, he said.The recounts are the first candidate-initiated recounts in a presidentialelection since 2000.The disputed Florida count in the 2000 presidential election hinged on a closevote in a problem-plagued election and resulted in Republican George Bushwinning the presidency despite Democratic Vice President Al Gore's nationalpopular vote win.On Wednesday Reform Party presidential nominee Rocque De La Fuente filed for arecount in Nevada, whichClintonnarrowlywon. He is reportedly considering askingfor a recount in Florida - with its coveted trove of 29 electoral votes - whichTrump won by nearly 120,000 votes."I'm only interested in validating the election and exposing the vulnerabilitiesI believe exist in our current system. I'm not trying to change the results," DeLa Fuente said on his website. "If that happens, so be it, but I'm not trying toforce it."Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein initiated the three-state recountonline fund raising effort last week and so far has raised nearly twice as muchas the $3.5 million she collected in her failed bid for president.Many states require those requesting recounts to pay costs, but taxpayers willfoot about $4 million of the bill in Michigan.Stein said on her website that recounts are needed to ensure that the electionresults are reliable. In Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, which use a mix ofelectronic touch screen voting machines and optical scan paper ballots, her teamquestioned the accuracy of electronic voting machines. In Michigan, which usesoptical scan paper ballots, Stein is questioning the "under vote," ballots whichwere cast with no vote for president.Under votes occur in every election and may be higher this year because of thehigh unfavorability ratings of the two major candidates, said Fred Woodhams,spokesman for the Michigan Department of State..Stein, who did not respond to requests for comment, offered no solid evidence ofcyber-hacking or other manipulation of election results.Two pro-Trump political action committees and a voter in Wisconsin on Thursdayfiled a lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Madison challenging the recount. InMichigan, Attorney General Bill Schuette, a Republican, sued on Friday to stopit in that state and Trump supporters also took legal action in Pennsylvania onThursday to stop a recount, according to the Associated Press.Mark Caleb Smith, director of the Cedarville University Center for PoliticalStudies, suggested that Stein may be pushing the recounts for reasons that gobeyond election integrity."If I had to guess I would say this is a way to fund-raise through the backdoor," he said. "I'm not saying it is corrupt, but it gives her resources tostay relevant for a while."Stein finished a distant fourth in the election but did play a spoiler role,said Daniel R. Birdsong, political science lecturer at the University of Dayton.In key states like Wisconsin and Michigan, Stein's vote totals surpassed themargin of difference between Trump and Clinton.Elections officials in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania have defended theintegrity of the vote. And the Clinton team's own lawyer - Marc Elias - said ina post on Medium that the campaign's analysis of the election found noindication of cyber-hacking or attempts to alter voting equipment or technology.He said Clinton's team would participate in the recount process to ensure it"proceeds in a manner that is fair to all sides."Trump received more electoral votes based on the states he won, but Clinton ison track to win the national popular vote by more than 2.5 million votes. TheU.S. Constitution gives the Electoral College final say and electors areexpected to pick Trump on Dec. 19.Trump took to Twitter to denounce the recount effort, saying the Green Party wasengaging in a "scam to fill up their coffers." Trump went on to say that he wasrobbed of the popular vote because "millions of people" voted illegally.Trump said Virginia, California and New Hampshire, all won by Clinton, had"serious fraud." But he and his campaign have provided no evidence and hisclaims have been widely debunked by fact-checkers.Leonard and other experts said they hope the recount effort gives the publicsome assurance that their votes are safe."It will hopefully lead to confirmation that the system worked as it should andthat election officials did their job admirably," said David Becker, executivedirector of the Center for Election Innovation and Research, a new non-profitworking to improve how elections are run.No one is calling for a recount in Ohio, where Trump won by 8.1 percentagepoints, and elections experts praised the state for running its elections well."Ohio is a wonderful example," said Becker. "You've got really good bipartisanboards (and) a secretary of state's office that's working very well with them."Contact this reporter at937-225-7455 or email Lynn.Hulsey@coxinc.com
