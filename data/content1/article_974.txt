Business scopeThe Washington Post has reported that at least 111 Trump companies have donebusiness in 18 countries and territories - creating a panoply of potentialethical pitfalls as Trump takes the nation's foreign policy reins.WASHINGTON - Democrats on Monday made their strongest call to date for acongressional investigation into President-elect Donald Trump's businessentanglements and possible conflicts of interest, asking the GOP's top Houseinvestigator to launch a formal probe.Seventeen Democratic members of the House Oversight and Government ReformCommittee called on the panel's chairman, Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, to "beginreviewing (Trump's) financial arrangements in order to identify and protectagainst conflicts of interest." The demand, in a seven-page letter, comes twoweeks after the committee's ranking Democrat, Rep. Elijah  Cummings, D-Md., madea similar request to Chaffetz.That request, according to the Democrats, did not receive a reply. A spokeswomanfor Chaffetz did not return a request for comment Monday."You have the authority to launch a Committee investigation, and we are callingon you to use that power now," Cummings and 16 other Democrats wrote. "You actedwith unprecedented urgency to hold 'emergency' hearings and issue multipleunilateral subpoenas to investigate (Democratic presidential nominee HillaryClinton) before the election. We ask that you show the same sense of urgencynow."The Democrats said their phone lines have been "flooded" by supporters of aninvestigation into Trump's business dealings, "jamming our phone lines with morecalls than we have ever received in response to any other issue."Their letter asks Chaffetz to request copies of Trump's income tax returns andto invite Trump aides to brief lawmakers on "their plans for protecting againstconflicts of interest." It cites  news reports raising questions about whetherTrump would be able to keep his business dealings at arm's length as long as hischildren continue running his companies under the Trump Organization umbrella.Last week, the Salt Lake Tribune, the largest paper in Chaffetz's home state,called on him to vigorously investigate Trump's finances.
