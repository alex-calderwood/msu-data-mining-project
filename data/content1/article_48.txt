WASHINGTON - Federal Reserve officials believed earlier this month that it wouldbe appropriate to raise a key interest rate "relatively soon," with some arguingfor a boost at the Fed's next meeting in December in order to preserve the Fed'scredibility.Minutes of the Nov. 1-2 meeting released Wednesday show that Fed officials weremoving closer to raising rates for the first time in nearly a year. Someofficials argued that if the Fed did not raise rates at its December meeting, itran the risk of harming the central bank's credibility given the many signals ithad sent about an impending hike.Private economists who widely expect the Fed would boost its benchmark rate by aquarter-point at its Dec. 13-14 meeting said there was nothing in the minutes tochange their forecast."The Fed meeting minutes say that the case for a rate hike keeps on gettingstronger and stronger," said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFGUnion Bank in New York."A rate hike is coming in December."Rupkey and other analysts said the open question is how many further increaseswill occur in 2017. Many analysts said they were still looking for just twohikes next year. But others said the Fed might make three hikes ifPresident-elect Donald Trump succeeds in pushing a big tax cut package andinfrastructure bill through Congress."Fiscal stimulus under the Trump administration could lead to stronger growth inoutput and prices, prompting the Fed to tighten policy more rapidly goingforward," said Sara Johnson, an economist with Global Insight.At the November meeting, the central bank left its benchmark rate unchanged in arange of 0.25 percent to 0.5 percent, where it has been all year. There had beenlittle expectation of a rate hike then.Economists believed that the Fed would not want to risk destabilizing financialmarkets with a rate increase just before voters went to the polls.The decision was approved on an 8-2 vote. Federal Reserve bank presidents EstherGeorge of Kansas City and Loretta Mester of Cleveland dissented because theyfavored an immediate rate increase.
