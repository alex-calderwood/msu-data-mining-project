This diverse force feels betrayed by trade and tax policies thatcreate immense affluence at the top and take wealth from workers."Workers will expect the president to keep his promise of a trade agenda thatputs their jobs above corporate profits."In defeating Democratic presidential nominee Hillary ClintoninOhio,Trumpscoredmajor gains in areas dominated by blue-collar workers.Even though Ohio's unemployment rate has tumbled from 11 percent in 2009 to 4.9percent last month, large areas of Ohio have lost manufacturing jobs during thepast four decades because of intense international competition and rapiddevelopments in automation by manufacturing companies.Portman pushesfor tax reformIn the wake of Trump's election, Sen. Rob Port-man, R-Ohio, again raised hisfavorite issue of overhauling the federal income tax code to make it simpler,with fewer income tax rates.In an interview last week on CNBC, Portman said: "On tax reform there's a chancewe can make this bipartisan.
