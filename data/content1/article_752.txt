Slow news day?More than a dozen news outlets picked up a story on Friday claiming that CNNaccidentally aired 30 minutes of pornography instead of Anthony Bourdain's PartsUnknown to Boston viewers via cable provider RCN.Those web news stories appear to just be based on a Twitter user, @solikearose,who claimed that the content was aired on Thursday evening. The CNN localnetwork provider denied that adult content was aired."We are in the process of researching this incident but see no evidence our CNNnetwork feed was compromised last evening in Boston," Jeff Carlson, svp andgeneral manager, RCN Boston, said in a statement to THR.Barbara Levin, vp communications at CNN national, said in a statement: "Despitemedia reports to the contrary, RCN assures us that there was no interruption ofCNN's programming in the Boston area last night."The apparentlyclaim arrives at a time when there's been a rare nationalconversation surrounding dissemination of fake news stories, primarily throughsocial media networks like Twitter and Facebook.That conversation was spurred from the flood of stories, many on Facebook, thatmade demonstrably fake claims during the U.S. presidential campaign in order todrive users from the social network to sites where those high-trafficked storiescould be monetized through display ads.
