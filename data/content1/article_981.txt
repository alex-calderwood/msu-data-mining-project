MADISON, Wis.  - The tedious task of recounting Wisconsin's nearly 3 millionvotes for president began Thursday with scores of hastily hired temporaryworkers flipping through stacks of ballots as observers watched their everymove.The action in Wisconsin could soon be duplicated in Michigan and Pennsylvania,where Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein was pushing for recounts.Donald Trump narrowly beat Hillary Clinton in all three states, but recountswere not expected to flip nearly enough votes to change the outcome in any ofthe states.Philadelphia city commissioners agreed to recount some ballots cast there, butrejected a forensic audit of how those voting machines work.The commissioners, in a brief meeting Thursday, agreed to start recountingFriday ballots in 75 divisions after Stein's campaign filed at least threeaffidavits for each division.The Wisconsin recount marked the first time in 16 years there was acandidate-driven recount of a presidential recount. But it does not carry thesame drama as the Florida presidential recount of 2000, when the outcome of theelection between Al Gore and George W. Bush hung in the balance."This is certainly not Bush v. Gore," said Wisconsin's chief electionsadministrator, Mike Haas.Even so, the campaigns for Trump, Clinton and Stein all had observers spreadthroughout the state to watch the process. The federal deadline to certify thevote to avoid having the fate of Wisconsin's 10 electoral votes decided byCongress is Dec. 13.Trump on Thursday objected to a recount of Michigan's presidential votes, atleast delaying the planned Friday start of the recount there until next week.The Board of State Canvassers will meet Friday to hear arguments.
