WASHINGTON - The administration of President Barack Obama is blocking new oiland gas drilling in the Arctic Ocean, handing a victory to environmentalists whosay industrial activity in the icy waters will harm whales, walruses and otherwildlife and exacerbate global warming.A five-year offshore drilling plan announced on Friday blocks the planned saleof new oil and gas drilling rights in the Chukchi and Beaufort seas north ofAlaska. The plan allows drilling to go forward in Alaska's Cook Inlet southwestof Anchorage.The blueprint for drilling from 2017 to 2022 can be rewritten by President-electDonald Trump, in a process that could take months or years.Besides Cook Inlet, the plan also allows drilling in the Gulf of Mexico, longthe center of U.S. offshore oil production. Ten of the 11 lease sales proposedin the five-year plan are in the Gulf, mostly off the coasts of Mississippi,Louisiana, Texas and Alabama.Confirming a decision announced this spring, the five-year plan also barsdrilling in the Atlantic Ocean.Industry representatives reacted bitterly to the announcement, calling thedecision blatantly political."The arrogance of the decision is unfathomable, but unfortunately notsurprising," said Randall Luthi, president of the National Ocean IndustriesAssociation, an industry group.
