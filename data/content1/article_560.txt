"DACA beneficiaries on our campuses have been exemplary studentscholars and student leaders, working across campus and in the community."With DACA, our students and alumni have been able to pursue opportunities inbusiness, education, high tech, and the nonprofit sector; they have gone tomedical school,law school and graduate schools in numerous disciplines. They are activelycontributing to their local communities and economies."The policy was a product of the Obama administration and many now wonder aboutits future under the administration of President-elect Donald Trump, who madeincreased immigration enforcement and curtailing the entry of some immigrants acentral part of his presidential campaign.

"We are prepared to meet with you to present ourcase. This is both a moral imperative and a national necessity.

They represent what is bestabout America, and as scholars and leaders they are essential to the future."According to Pomona College spokeswoman Patricia Cecilia Zurita, "dozens ofpresidents have joined the initiative already."As of 10:30 a.m. Monday, more than 130 college and university presidents frompublic and private institutions have a signed statement offering to meet withU.S. leaders on the issue.Oxtoby's letter puts him in step with other California educators andpoliticians, including California State University Chancellor Timothy P.
