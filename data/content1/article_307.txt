There's been much said about the differences between the people who voted forRepublican presidential candidate Donald Trump and those who voted for DemocratHillary Clinton.To a general extent, but not exclusively, more populous and more diverse areasof the country went for Clinton, while more rural areas with less diversepopulations voted for Trump.Pundits like to generalize. Better-educated and white-collar people voted forClinton, while less-educated and blue-collar workers generally voted for Trump.Forward-thinking people voted for Clinton. Angry people voted for Trump, theytheorize.But few seem to be considering another factor that's both cultural and economic:Call it the producers versus the consumers.Looking at the map of which states went for which candidate, it is clear that,generally speaking (with some exceptions), more populous areas went withClinton. The populations of those states, it could be argued, are mostlyconsumers who have little connection or understanding to where the food they eator the energy they burn comes from.Yet the people in the red states are more likely to be the farmers, theranchers, the growers - or to be connected with someone who is - and have betterunderstanding of the time, the effort, the care, the expense, the danger and thereward of producing food.They are more likely to innately understand that new, burdensome rules imposedby a far-off and disconnected government in Washington - likely staffed withpeople who grew up in populated areas and went to the best colleges - havelittle understanding for their line of work.The same can be said for energy. The people in the red states are more likely tobe coal miners, oil and gas field workers, tanker truck drivers, pipelineworkers, and others who toil and sweat in producing and delivering mass volumesof energy the consuming states need to power their iPhones, air conditioners andvehicles.They feel the burdens of new regulation and higher costs imposed by nonconnectedgovernment bureaucrats and well-intentioned Democratic officials.While many of this consuming class don't understand why so many Americans wouldvote for the highly flawed and controversial Trump, so many of the producingclass don't understand why the Democratic Party wants to keep growing governmentand keep adding rules to their work.The chasm of understanding between the producers and the consumers won't lessenon its own. To promote understanding among nations, many schools anduniversities exchange students. It's are a great way to increase communicationand build understanding among different cultures.Perhaps its time to consider cultural and economic exchange programs in our owncountry - sending city folk to the country and vice versa - to help us allbetter understand the challenges and issues differing people face.
