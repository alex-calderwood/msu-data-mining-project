WASHINGTON - Less than a week after indicating he would not seek a position inPresident-elect Donald Trump's administration, retired Johns Hopkinsneurosurgeon Ben Carson has seemed to soften that stance, indicating he wouldgive any offer "serious consideration."The renowned physician ran an unsuccessful campaign for president this year andthen became an early and vocal surrogate for Trump.Carson's background in health care made him the center of speculation as apossible secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. His name hasalso come up as a potential secretary of education."Basically, I've said my preference is to be outside and to act as an adviser,but if after going through the process they all conclude it would be much betterto have me in the Cabinet, I would have to give that very seriousconsideration," Carson told Fox News on Sunday. "It's just not my preference."The comments came days after Carson and his aides appeared to throw cold wateron the idea of a job in the administration. His business manager and spokesman,Armstrong Williams, told several media outlets last week that Carson was notinterested."Dr. Carson feels he has no government experience, he's never run a federalagency," Williams told The Hill newspaper in Washington. "The last thing hewould want to do was take a position that could cripple the presidency."Trump has focused since the election on building a national security team, buthe has also met in recent days with several national education leaders.Several Marylanders are under consideration for jobs in Trump's administration.The name of John Bolton, a former ambassador to the United Nations, was floatedearly as a possible secretary of state.
