Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams-who has never hidden his designs on GracieMansion-formally endorsed Mayor Bill de Blasio in Brooklyn for re-election nextyear because "he gets it."Joining the mayor at Salem Baptist Church this morning, Adams became the firsthypothetical Democratic rival of de Blasio's to back the mayor for a secondterm. Pollsters have repeatedly included the former Central Brooklyn statesenator alongside Bronx Borough President Ruben Diaz Jr. and Comptroller ScottStringer when surveying voters on potential primary match-ups."Nothing is better than having a leader of a city that is as diverse as NewYork, particularly Brooklyn, 47 percent of Brooklynites speak a language otherthan English at home," Adams said, praising the mayor for repeatedly pushingback on President-elect Donald Trump. "He gets it. He gets it that we may or maynot be living in Trump Tower but our houses are our towers."The borough president fended off criticisms that the mayor hasn't moved fastenough in resolving key issues, saying that "our children are getting smarterand our streets are safer.""Now more than ever, we need a mayor that's willing to out-trump Trump, a Mayorthat's willing to stand up and fight for the values and principles of this cityand this country," Adams said. "A person who's not only tall in stature but agiant among those little midgets that are going to hold the city back."And Adams, a former NYPD captain, defended the mayor amid his bitter clasheswith police unions and former NYPD commissioner Raymond Kelly over theadministration's handling of crime and of Black Lives Matter protests thatflooded the streets in the aftermath of a cop's 2014 killing of Staten IslanderEric Garner.Today, Adams said that as an ex-police officer, he can tell when people "fakethe funk." He criticized Hillary Clinton for not coming to the church during thepresidential campaign"All roads to leadership go through Salem and Hillary should've gotten thememo," he said. "She should've understood that it's the Salems of this city andcountry where the hopes and dreams of people are. This mayor gets it."A recent Quinnipiac University survey found that nearly half of New Yorkersbelieve de Blasio doesn't deserve reelection next fall found, but that in animprobable five-way primary, de Blasio would pull 34 percent of the Democraticvote and that Adams would draw 21 percent. Of those polled, 74 percent indicatedthat they "haven't heard enough" about Adams.Adams is a longtime rival to Congressman Hakeem Jeffries, an outspoken de Blasiocritic who recently said he has not ruled out a run for mayor. The twoAfrican-American pols share the same base of voters in Central Brooklyn,particularly in their native neighborhood of Crown Heights.De Blasio used the occasion to reiterate his efforts to relieve New Yorkers'fears about what could occur under a Trump presidency.He said he looked Trump "in the eye" during their meeting at Trump Tower thisweek and told him that the city has become safer since drastically reducing theuse of stop-and-frisk policing, a tactic the Republican president-elect haspraised. And he said the immigrant experience "made America great"-a jab atTrump's "Make America Great Again" campaign slogan."Anyone who wants to revise history and airbrush out the immigrants is going tofind very little left in America and we need to have that conversation," hesaid. "We need to take action because one election does not change who we are.It does not."Later this afternoon, former Mayor David Dinkins-the city's first and only blackmayor-endorsed the mayor at the Convent Avenue Baptist Church in Harlem. The twoshare a long history, as de Blasio volunteered for his 1989 mayoral campaign andworked for him as a City Hall staffer, which is how he met his future wifeChirlane McCray, then a Dinkins speechwriter.At a ceremony where he renamed the Manhattan Municipal Building for Dinkins lastyear, he said that history does not acknowledge Dinkins' accomplishments.Just six days after his former boss Hillary Clinton lost the presidentialelection, the Uniformed Sanitationmen's Association-which represents 14,000active and retired garbage handlers-announced its support for a second de Blasioterm, his first union endorsement. And three days ago, building workers union32BJ SEIU, which represents doormen, custodians and security guards, announcedit would, too.McCray said today Adams attended the launch of her ThriveNYC initiative tocombat the city's mental health crisis, had pushed hard for the mayor's Pre-Kfor All initiative and that he is in a unique position to improvepolice-community relations."Eric shares the values that strengthen our communities and we're so proud tohave him stand with us today," she said.Disclosure: Donald Trump is the father-in-law of Jared Kushner, the publisher ofObserver Media.
