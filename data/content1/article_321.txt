INSIDE:editorial onTrump'sclaims4ANEW YORK - President-elect Donald Trump is claiming, without evidence, thatmillions of people voted illegally in the election he won, issuing the baselessclaim as part of his angry response to a recount effort led by the Green Partyand joined by Hillary Clinton's campaign."I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who votedillegally, Trump tweeted Sunday. He later alleged "serious voter fraud inVirginia, New Hampshire and California.Trump's transition team did not provide any evidence to back up thepresident-elect's assertions of fraud in the November election. They pointedonly to past charges of irregularities in voter registration.Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., said Monday he had "not seen any voterirregularity in the millions."I don't know what he was talking about on that one, Lankford said of Trump onCNN's "New Day.Indeed, there has been no evidence of widespread tampering or hacking that wouldchange the results of the presidential contest between Trump and Clinton. TheDemocrat's team said it had been looking for abnormalities and found nothingthat would alter the results.Still, Clinton's campaign was joining a recount led by Green Party candidateJill Stein in up to three states. The Wisconsin Elections Commission votedunanimously Monday to approve a recount that could begin Thursday, after paymentis received from Stein and an independent candidate also requesting a recount.Recounts are possible in Pennsylvania and Michigan as well."We intend to participate in order to ensure the process proceeds in a mannerthat is fair to all sides, Clinton campaign attorney Marc Elias said.Trump narrowly won Wisconsin and Pennsylvania and, as of last Wednesday, held alead of almost 11,000 votes in Michigan, with the results awaiting statecertification Monday. All three would need to flip to Clinton to upend theRepublican's victory, and Clinton's team says Trump has a larger edge in allthree states than has ever been overcome in a presidential recount.After spending the Thanksgiving holiday in Florida, Trump was back in New Yorkfor meetings with potential Cabinet nominees. His team was divided over hischoices for secretary of state, particularly the prospect that Trump could tap2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney for the prominent post.Romney is scheduled to hold his second in-person meeting with Trump on Tuesday.But the president-elect is also looking at other options, meeting Monday withretired Gen. David Petraeus and on Tuesday with Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker, thechairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.In an unusual public airing of internal machinations, Trump senior adviserKellyanne Conway warned Sunday that the president-elect's supporters would feel"betrayed if he tapped Romney as secretary of state. Romney denounced Trump inscathing terms during the campaign, prompting Trump to call him a "choker who"walks like a penguin.The spectacle of close aides who speak frequently with Trump in private being soexplicit about their personal opinions in public raised the possibility thatConway was acting at Trump's behest.People involved in the transition process said Trump's decision on his secretaryof state did not appear to be imminent. Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giulianiwas initially seen as the favorite for the diplomatic post, but Trump is said tohave grown irritated by questions about Giuliani's international business ties,as well as the mayor's public campaigning for the job.Even with major administration decisions looming, Trump seems preoccupied by theprospect of a recount."Hillary Clinton conceded the election when she called me just prior to thevictory speech and after the results were in, He tweeted Sunday. "Nothing willchange.He quoted from Clinton's concession speech - "We owe him an open mind and thechance to lead - and he concluded: "So much time and money will be spent - sameresult! Sad.On NBC's "Meet the Press, Conway said Stein, "the Hillary people and otherssupporting recounts have to decide whether they are going to back a peacefultransition "or if they're going to be a bunch of crybabies and sore losers aboutan election that they can't turn around.Clinton's lawyer said her team has been combing through the results since theelection in search of anomalies that would suggest hacking by Russians or othersand found "no actionable evidence. But "we feel it is important, on principle,to ensure our campaign is legally represented in any court proceedings andrepresented on the ground in order to monitor the recount process itself, hesaid.
