The City Council Women's Caucus rolled out its first-ever "legislative equalitypackage"-which members touted as a counterblast to President-elect DonaldTrump's agenda.The agenda, five months in the making, includes bills that call for the creationof a task force to assess the city university system's affordability, admissionsand graduation rates, a report on the use of long-acting reversiblecontraceptives such as intrauterine devices, sexual assault awareness andprevention training for cab drivers, a street co-naming for the original Ms.Magazine headquarters and expanding the definition of employer under the humanrights law to offer protections for domestic workers. Brooklyn CouncilwomanLaurie Cumbo, the caucus co-chair, recalled Trump's past assertions thatpregnancy in the workplace is an "inconvenience" and the 2005 video that caughthim describing how his wealth and influence enabled him to sexually assaultwomen with impunity-and specifically to "grab them by the pussy."Cumbo voiced her rage and disgust that such language "will be spoken in theWhite House.""This election has fired me up like I've never been fired up before," Cumbosaid. "This is our time. I've never been shaken to my core like I have beenthrough this electoral process."The goal of the package, she said, is to make sure that women's rights areprotected, adding that "this is such a phenomenal time in our her-story.""We have to tear this nation upside down," continued Cumbo, who also serves aschairwoman of the Council's Committee on Women's Issues. "We gotta set it rightand we have to utilize this as our battlecry to make sure that women and girlsall across this country know that they can be whatever they want to be."The councilwoman added that the entire caucus will participate in the Women'sMillion March in Washington, D.C. on January 21.The package also contains resolutions calling for a study of toxins incosmetics, support for a New York State bill that bans employers from askingpotential applicants for their salary history and another state bill thatprovides domestic violence survivors with better access to breaking leases.The package also includes bills that have already been signed into law: acomprehensive plan to address unpaid caregivers' needs, providing femininehygiene products to students for free while they are on the premises of the NewYork City Department of Education and a report on procedures and policies forthe Rikers Island nursery program.Last month, ahead of the presidential election, a multiracial andmultigenerational group of women protested outside Trump Tower where theylambasted him a "sexual predator" over the crude tape and for his stances onwomen's issues. A similar rally led by New York's female Democrats took place atthe Manhattan headquarters and included Public Advocate Letitia James, ManhattanBorough President Gale Brewer and Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney.Councilwoman Helen Rosenthal, the caucus's other co-chairwoman, said that thepresidential race exposed the struggles and inequities that women across thenation face. She noted that over the past three years, more women have served insenior leadership roles within the mayor's office and city agencies and thatmore resources have been allocated to increase participation of minority- andwomen-owned businesses and enterprises."It's a challenge that the New York City Women's Caucus is committed to and onewe will meet by continuing our work to shape local, state and national policy oneducation, healthcare, public safety and labor," Rosenthal said, alluding to thecandidacy of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, who Trump defeated in theElectoral College earlier this month. "And as a certain first lady once said,women's rights are human rights."Members of the de Blasio administration also came out to express their supportfor the agenda, highlighting some of the work the mayor has done to promotegender equity."It's great to be in the room with women and I think that power is in thehouse," Azadeh Khalili, the first-ever executive director of the city'sCommission on Gender Equity whom de Blasio appointed in March, said. "I reallybelieve I want every woman and every girl to know that in New York City you havea mayor who's committed to women and girls and you have a City Council that hasmade a commitment to making sure that we create better outcomes for every womanand girl."Cecile Noel, commissioner of the Mayor's Office to Combat Domestic Violence,noted that in October, the mayor announced Paid Safe Leave legislation, whichwould allow domestic violence survivors to take paid leave from work to dealwith urgent safety needs without fear of penalty. She also said the city isputting housing legal assistance in the family justice centers."Our mayor is behind us in so many things and we have a phenomenal leader in ourFirst Lady, who sees the importance of really doing this work and pushing theagenda, being the leader, and so we are so happy," Noel said.Disclosure: Donald Trump is the father-in-law of Jared Kushner, the publisher ofObserver Media.
