VATICAN CITY  - Pope Francis warned against what he called a "virus ofpolarization" and hostility in the world targeting people  of differentnationalities, races or beliefs, as he led a ceremony Saturday giving the RomanCatholic Church 17 new cardinals from six continents, including Blase Cupich,bishop of the Spokane diocese before he was named archbishop in Chicago.The consistory ceremony in St. Peter's Basilica formally inducted the churchmeninto the cardinals' ranks.Francis used his homily to also caution the new "princes of the church," ascardinals are sometimes called, to guard against animosity creeping into thechurch as well, saying "we are not immune from this."The pope spoke of "our pitiful hearts that tend to judge, divide, oppose andcondemn" and cautioned somberly against those who "raise walls, build barriersand label people."Earlier this year, when asked about the plan by Donald Trump, then a RepublicanU.S. presidential candidate and now president-elect, to build a wall to keepMexicans from entering the U.S., the pope replied that anyone advocatingbuilding walls isn't a Christian.In Saturday's homily, Francis commented how "we see, for example, how quicklythose among us with the status of the stranger, an immigrant, or a refugee,become a threat, take on the status of an enemy. An enemy because they come froma distant country, or have different customs."He added: "The virus of polarization and animosity permeates our way ofthinking, feeling and acting."Saturday's appointment of  Cupich to cardinal in the Catholic Church follows acareer path that rocketed ahead in the past six years - from leading a ruraldiocese in western South Dakota to fixing a bankrupted church in Spokane and totaking over the influential position as archbishop of Chicago.Before he was named archbishop of Chicago, the third-largest Catholic diocese inthe United States, two years ago, Cupich was called to Spokane to fix a diocesestruggling with the aftermath of bankruptcy brought about by lawsuits filedafter decades of child sex abuse by clergy.He moved quickly, reviewing what he saw as a flawed and controversial settlementwith victims that left churches exposed to future litigation and parishionersdisgusted by both the actions of church leaders and the roughly $50 million usedto pay victims, lawyers and other bills.Cupich, 67, was ordained in 1975. He has been considered one of the church'sthought leaders in responding to crisis and preserving mission. His reputationis one of a pragmatist. He chooses words and strategy carefully and has madedecisions that have earned him the tag of a moderate among Catholic leaders.Before he came to Spokane in 2010, he was the bishop for 12 years in Rapid City,South Dakota.Cupich, after being made a cardinal at Saturday's ceremony, said the church hasa special role in trying to bring people together across the political spectrum.He noted that on Sunday, Masses are celebrated in 26 languages in his diocese."People feel disenfranchised" from sharing in the common good, the cardinal saidin an interview with the Associated Press.Another American in the latest crop of cardinals is Irish-born Archbishop KevinFarrell, who led the Dallas diocese before Francis appointed him to head theVatican office dealing with family issues.At a post-ceremony reception, Farrell acknowledged that polarization is feltwithin the church, too."We've become gods on both sides - gods on the left, and gods on the right, andneither one of these are correct," Farrell told an AP reporter.The clash of mentalities between the conservative camps and the so-calledprogressives chosen by Francis has played out publicly in recent days. Fourprominent, disgruntled cardinals, including a U.S. prelate, Raymond Burke, whois one of Francis' most vocal critics, in a letter to the pope aired theirdoubts about his more compassionate approach to the contentious issue involvingdivorced Catholics. They fear his approach could sow confusion among thefaithful.Church teaching forbids divorce, and says Catholics who remarry withoutannulments of their earlier marriage are essentially adulterers who can'treceive Communion. In a document earlier this year, Francis suggested thatclerics could decide case-by-case if these Catholics could receive Communion.Farrell, asked about the tensions over the divorce issue, appeared to be opentoward the pope's prescription for more compassion."There is no situation in life that's black and white. Anybody that's lived inthis world will have encountered those situations in their personal lives,"Farrell said.The new cardinals, who pledged loyalty to the pope, come from Africa, Asia,Europe, Oceania, and North and South America.One of them, an 88-year-old Albanian priest, Ernest Simoni, spent 18 years inprison because of his faith during the communist regime in his homeland.Since cardinals are usually bishops already, Francis bestowed a rare honor ingiving that rank to Simoni, a simple priest. When Francis visited Albania in2014, he was brought to tears when Simoni told him how he was persecuted.Also among the new cardinals is Archbishop Dieudonne Nzapalainga, of Bangui,Central African Republic. Last year, Francis visited Nzapalainga's country,bloodied by sectarian violence between Christian and Muslim militants.
