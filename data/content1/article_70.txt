Whether you are a Republican or Democrat you are forced to acknowledge themasterful job done by Donald Trump in being elected president of the UnitedStates.Using campaign rhetoric and actions that some of us deemed repugnant oroff-putting, the Donald knew exactly what to say and do in order to mobilize hisbase constituency, convincing them along the way of numerous "facts" ofquestionable veracity, such as the election being rigged, the futureconstruction of a Great Wall paid for by Mexico, President Barack Obama notbeing born in the United States, etc. Many of these things are still consideredto be true by that constituency.Jamming his candidacy down the throats of the Republican hierarchy was a thingof beauty and even more impressive was his ability to get many Christianreligious organizations to prostitute themselves under the rationalization thatthe "end justifies the means."Perhaps the biggest accomplishment, however, was the exquisite timing of thehacked Democratic party emails and the last minute, on again/off againinvestigation of Hillary Clinton by the FBI. Those actions sounded the deathknell for Clinton's presidential aspirations, and made Tricky Dick and Watergatepale in comparison.Bravo, Mr. Trump. Well played.Robert J. GosikSt. George
