NBC reported the decision was made for West's"own health and safety."Los Angeles police, without identifying West, told City News Service theyresponded to a disturbance call at 1:20 p.m. in the 800 block of North LaurelAvenue, near the Fairfax District, but when officers arrived, it turned out tobe a medical emergency, and paramedics were called.West had been scheduled to perform at 8 p.m. Sunday at the Forum, but thatconcert was called off at about 5 p.m. Some concertgoers did not learn of thecancellation until they showed up at the Inglewood arena. The concert wassupposed to be a makeup for West leaving early from a Nov. 3 appearance at theForum due to what he called vocal issues.One day earlier, the rapper - who is married to reality television personalityKim Kardashian - walked off stage only four songs into a concert in Sacramento,a show in which he took the stage about 90 minutes late.At that concert, West went into a tirade in which he railed against Beyonce, JayZ, Hillary Clinton, the radio industry and the media, before exiting the stage.On Thursday, during a San Jose appearance, he elicited boos when he told thecrowd in a well-publicized, profanity-laced dialogue that he didn't vote in therecent presidential election, but he would have voted for Donald Trump.
