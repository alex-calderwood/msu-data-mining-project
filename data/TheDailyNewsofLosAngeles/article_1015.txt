In fact, winning apresidential election never is, despite the opinion of too many pundits. EvenRepublican President Ronald Reagan recognized this when he won a landslidere-election in 1984, winning 49 states and garnering 525 electoral votes.In the aftermath of that election, Reagan pushed bipartisan support of laws hesigned and ensured his Republican Party worked with Democrats in Congress.Despite the opinion of some, President-elect Trump's victory is not a mandate,either, and not because he lost the popular vote or because we are coming out ofthe most divisive election cycle in modern history, where many in the countryare viewing his imminent presidency with a great deal of skepticism and concern.It's because when a president or a political party treats any one election as amandate and overreaches, it quickly loses the reins of power.After his historic 2008 victory, President Obama had the wind at his back.Democrats regained the presidency after eight years and held majorities in boththe Senate and the House of Representatives. His party was unified and poisedfor potentially unparalleled legislative achievement, believing that the countryhad endorsed an ambitious progressive agenda.Early in his presidential tenure, Obama pushed what would ultimately become hissignature legislative achievement - the Affordable Care Act (colloquiallyreferred to as Obamacare). It was pushed through Congress without a singleRepublican vote in either the House or the Senate, in the face of widespreadpublic opposition to the legislation.That single action started a chain of events, beginning with a revolt by votersin 2010, costing President Obama's Democratic Party to lose its majority in theHouse and drop six seats in the Senate. It is also what spawned the Tea Party,and, thus, the beginnings of an early base of support for Trump, a politicalfigure who personifies all that Obama demonized.Ever since, Obama has had a combative relationship with Congress devoid ofmutual trust or admiration. Republicans in Congress bear some of the blame, asthey refused to work with Obama.The result is unfortunate: Since 2010, President Obama has had no other majorlegislative achievements. Contrast that with former Presidents Bill Clinton andReagan - both who faced Congresses controlled by the opposition party - and youwill see a stark contrast in approach and, thus, accomplishment. In fact, Reagan had a rule that he would notsign a bill into law without at least some Democratic support, and Clinton'spenchant for political deal-making was the hallmark of his success as president.For the last six years in Washington, compromise was replaced with contempt.Polarization has overtaken collaboration and it's become more politicallyexpedient to bash political opponents than to find common ground.President Obama's response to the gridlock was to attempt to legislate by fiat,that is, to use executive orders to sidestep a Congress that he chastised asbeing controlled by the "Party of no." As Marc Thiessen wrote for the WashingtonPost, "The reason Obama's legacy is so vulnerable today is that the 44thpresident relied more on executive actions - issuing not only executive orders,but also a record number of rules, regulations and agency directives tolegislate around Congress and impose his agenda."Thiessen also recalled: "After he lost control of the Senate in 2014, Obamaannounced at his first Cabinet meeting: 'We're not just going to be waiting forlegislation. ... I've got a pen and I've got a phone. And I can use that pen tosign executive orders and take executive actions and administrative actions thatmove the ball forward.'"What this means, though, is on Day One in office, President Trump could undoevery single one of the actions Obama made with his pen and phone. That's whythe role of the president is not that of a legislator, but instead acollaborative role that must persuade and work with Congress to pass legislationby a large enough margin that the next president and Congress will not undo it.Now Trump, winning an even more alienating campaign than either of the two thatObama won, must grapple with the realities of governing an even more dividedcountry. The Republican Party will control the White House, the Senate and theHouse of Representatives, but if it overreaches it will face the same kind ofbacklash Democrats and President Obama felt in the 2010 and 2014 elections.Brian Calle is opinion editor for the Southern California News Group.
