Green Party candidate Jill Stein said Monday her campaign will seek a courtorder to require a presidential recount in Wisconsin be conducted by hand.Stein's campaign said it will file a petition in Dane County asking a judge torule that the state's recount may only be conducted by hand. The state ElectionsCommission voted Monday morning to let each of the state's 72 counties decidewhether to count ballots by hand or by machine, as state statutes allow.Stein and Reform Party candidate Roque "Rocky" De La Fuente filed separatepetitions late Friday afternoon for a recount in Wisconsin, which would be thestate's first in a presidential election.State elections officials met Monday morning to approve a timeline for therecount, which will proceed only if one or both of the campaigns submit paymentby 4:30 p.m. Tuesday.Stein received about 31,000 votes in Wisconsin, where president-elect DonaldTrump defeated Democratic former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton by about22,000 votes. De La Fuente received about 1,500 votes in Wisconsin.In her recount petition, Stein alleged some electronic voting machines inWisconsin are "susceptible to compromise." She suggested there were"irregularities" in the state's vote totals that "indicate potential tamperingwith electronic voting systems.""Without utilizing these (hand count) methods, a recount would not exclude thepossibility of a breach that resulted in a miscounting of votes," Stein wrote inher petition.Stein cites an affidavit from J. Alex Halderman, a professor of computer scienceand engineering at the University of Michigan, who argued "vote-stealingmalware" could have been installed on machines in battleground states likeWisconsin.Wisconsin elections administrator Michael Haas said Monday that electionsofficials are "skeptical" of those claims. The state's machines are notconnected to the internet, a point Halderman said is irrelevant.A person would have to physically access each individual voting machine totamper with the state's election results, elections supervisor Ross Hein said.Elections Commission chairman Mark Thomsen said he expects the recount will notchange the results, even if the margins are adjusted. He lauded the state's"very decentralized" elections process, conducted by county and municipal clerksand volunteers throughout the state.
