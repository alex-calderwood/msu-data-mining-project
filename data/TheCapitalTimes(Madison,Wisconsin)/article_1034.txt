Wisconsin elections officials on Monday approved an "aggressive" timeline for apresidential recount expected to start later this week.Green Party candidate Jill Stein and Reform Party candidate Roque "Rocky" De LaFuente filed separate petitions late Friday afternoon for a recount inWisconsin, which would be the state's first in a presidential election.Wisconsin officials estimate a presidential recount in the state will costnearly $3.5 million.Payment was due from either or both campaigns by 4:30 p.m. Tuesday to trigger arecount order. If both campaigns pay in full, half the cost will be refunded toeach candidate.The timeline is "tight and aggressive," said elections supervisor Ross Hein."It is going to be very challenging for many of our county clerks and canvassmembers to complete this recount in less than two weeks," Hein said.The last statewide recount conducted in Wisconsin was in the 2011 state SupremeCourt race between Justice David Prosser and Judge JoAnne Kloppenburg. Thatrecount tightened Prosser's victory margin from 7,316 votes to 7,004 votes.The 2011 recount didn't face the federal deadline pressures that govern thisone, with a federal Dec. 13 deadline to certify electoral votes.The biggest challenge in meeting that deadline could be finding enough people towork evenings and weekends to complete the recount, elections administratorMichael Haas said.Elections Commission chairman Mark Thomsen noted the commission's first officialnotice of the potential for a recount came at 3 p.m. the Friday afterThanksgiving."You've got to assume a lot of people were deer hunting, a lot of people werespending time with family for Thanksgiving," he said.The commission rejected Stein's request to order a hand recount, instead leavingit up to each county to determine whether to count votes by hand or by machine.Stein received about 31,000 votes in Wisconsin, where president-elect DonaldTrump defeated Democratic former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton by about22,000 votes.A lawyer for Clinton's campaign said Saturday the campaign would participate inthe recount "to ensure the process proceeds in a manner that is fair to allsides." Trump criticized the effort on Twitter."In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popularvote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally," Trump tweetedSunday, although no evidence exists to back up his claim.Thomsen said it is "inappropriate" to suggest the state's votes weren't properlytabulated or that illegal votes were counted.Thomsen said he'd like Trump to "come down out of his Trump Tower" and spendtime watching poll workers in Waushara or Wautoma counties. To say votes arebeing counted illegally is "an insult to the people that run our elections," hesaid.Asked why he wasn't more critical of Stein for suggesting the election wascompromised, Thomsen noted she received just 1 percent of the vote in Wisconsin,while Trump is the president-elect."Someone has the bully pulpit, someone has an impact on our citizens' right totrust what happens down the block at their polling places," he said. "I've neverseen this kind of attack on poll workers and how this system works."Stein has alleged Wisconsin's election results could have been manipulated by acyber-attack. Haas said elections officials are "skeptical" of those claims. Thestate's machines are not connected to the internet.A person would have to physically access each individual voting machine totamper with the state's election results, Hein said.Thomsen said he expects the recount will not change the results."If nothing else, this will give us a very good audit," Thomsen said. "It'sgoing to reassure Wisconsin voters that we have a fair system, that we're notcounting illegal votes, we're not counting dead people's votes and it's really,really important to know that in Wisconsin, elections are fair and accurate andconducted by hardworking people."
