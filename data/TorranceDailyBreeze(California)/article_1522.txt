You are right on - California isreally out of touch with what the rest of the country is feeling right now andis determined to keep its liberal stance on all manner of issues, from itschoice of president to all the ballot measures that passed.Now that the rest of the country has spoken, we do need to come together and tryto get this country going again. I believe that President-elect Donald Trump isgenuinely trying to do that, as evidenced by his consideration for his Cabinetof former rivals for the Republican presidential nomination, even those who werebitterly opposed to him.With the Republican majority in both the executive and legislative branches andas well as many of the governorships, this could be the chance of a lifetime toreally turn things around in this country and make things better for everyone!- Clare Burr, Los AngelesLincoln and CalexitRe "Should California split from the U.S.?" (Question of the Week, Nov. 15):Shades of John Calhoun, states' rights, nullification and secession, thisburgeoning talk of Calexit ignores the lessons of the Civil War, which I hadthought were firmly impressed in our national consciousness.Abraham Lincoln put it concisely in his first inaugural address, March 4, 1861:"I hold that in contemplation of universal law and of the Constitution the unionof these states is perpetual. ..."It follows ... that no state upon its own mere motion can lawfully get out ofthe Union; that resolves and ordinances to that effect are legally void; andthat acts of violence, within any state or states, against the authority of theUnited States, are insurrectionary or revolutionary, according to circumstances."I, therefore, consider that, in view of the Constitution and the laws, theUnion is unbroken. ..."... we find the proposition that in legal contemplation the Union is perpetualconfirmed by the history of the Union itself."Let us realize that we are all in this union together, for better or worse, andour efforts would be better spent to make a more perfect union than trying toundo it.- Carl Pearlston, Torrance
