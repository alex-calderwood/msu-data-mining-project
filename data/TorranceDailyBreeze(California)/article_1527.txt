This week, President Obama, on his last official visit toEurope, again went to Berlin, and in a joint news conference with GermanChancellor Angela Merkel reflected on the status of the transatlanticrelationship. And later Obama, Merkel and other key European leaders agreedunanimously to keep sanctions on Russia for intervening in Ukraine.President-elect Donald Trump, whose conciliatory and even flattering wordsregarding Russian President Vladimir Putin have caused anxiety among manyEuropean leaders, let alone Republicans like Arizona Sen. John McCain, shouldrecognize that this type of Western cohesion is necessary in an unstable world.Obama made that clear last week. "Our alliance with our NATO partners has been acornerstone of U.S. foreign policy for nearly 70 years - in good times and inbad, and through presidents of both parties - because the United States has afundamental interest in Europe's stability and security," he said. On Russia,Obama said that he hopes Trump "does not simply take a realpolitik approach."For her part, Merkel said of Russia: "This is all about respecting certainprinciples. ... So the fact that for over 70 years we have been able to enjoypeace, to live in peace very much depends on territorial integrity andsovereignty of each and every European country being respected. In view of theEuropean history, the reverse would be the start of a very bitter road down aslippery slope, and we have to nip this in the bud. We have to stand upresolutely against any such attempts."The global instability the incoming president will face is best met throughmultinational efforts. Indeed, during the campaign Trump was reticent aboutAmerica's overstretched global role. But building consensus requires cohesion,and Trump's intemperate remarks (Merkel is "ruining Germany," he tweeted afterMerkel was tabbed Time's "Person of the Year") and his choice to meet NigelFarage, the former United Kingdom Independence Party leader who championedBrexit, before U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May are the type of mistakes he mustnow avoid.Both Obama and Merkel commented on the potent populism roiling both sides of theAtlantic, and in fact Brexit and Trump's triumph may be part of a broaderpattern that could be repeated in upcoming European elections. But just as itwould have been inappropriate for European leaders to get involved in the U.S.election, the next president should refrain from favoring anti-E.U. candidates.Indeed, Trump may soon learn the benefits, if not necessity, of strongtransatlantic links.Saying he was "cautiously optimistic about my successor and the shift fromcampaign mode to governance," Obama added that the presidency itself might be atempering influence. "There's something about the solemn responsibility of thatoffice, the extraordinary demands that are placed on the United States - notjust by its own people but by people around the world - that forces you tofocus, that demands seriousness."
