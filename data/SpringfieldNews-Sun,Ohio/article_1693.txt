Bush and independent candidateRoss Perot.Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted Thursday certified the official results ofthe 2016 General Election.Here are some of the highlights:5,607,641 Ohioans cast ballots out of 7,861,025 registered voters, for a voterturnout of 71.33 percent;President-Elect Donald Trump carried 80 of Ohio's 88 counties -- includingMontgomery, Clark, Butler, Greene, Miami, Warren, Preble, Darke, Shelby andChampaign counties;1,890,069 absentee ballots were cast, topping the 2012 total of 1,876,174 andthe 2008 figure of 1,717,256. About 34 percent of all ballots cast came beforeElection Day.Democrats historically have done better in early voting, but that may not be thecase this year.
