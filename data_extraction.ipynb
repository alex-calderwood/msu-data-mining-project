      "Obviously, a Hillary Clinton presidency would have been historic. The symbolism\n",
      "of Clinton's inauguration as the first women president would have resonated\n",
      "world-wide as a mark of the progress that American women have achieved in all\n",
      "walks of life. Instead, the post-mortem is well underway about why, despite all\n",
      "the polls and pundit predictions, Clinton lost.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many are pointing to sexism as the main culprit, yet no empirical evidence\n",
      "exists to back it up. We know that sexist and misogynistic views exist within\n",
      "our society, and that negative stereotypes about women are constantly promoted\n",
      "within our mass media. However, proving a link between sexist views and voting\n",
      "behavior, with any validity, is impossible. Public opinion polls for years have\n",
      "shown support for electing a woman president, suggesting that a majority of\n",
      "Americans are not deterred by a woman candidate. Partisanship was more than\n",
      "likely the deciding factor in 2016 as severe polarization has continued among\n",
      "the American electorate, as were economic issues as evidenced by Donald Trump's\n",
      "success in the Rust Belt.\n",
      "\n",
      "Similarly, gender bias in news coverage is also a popular theory for why Clinton\n",
      "lost. While sexist and misogynistic language exists, particularly online and in\n",
      "social media, there is no empirical evidence to suggest this can effect voter\n",
      "preference or turnout. If a blogger or cable news pundit writes or says\n",
      "something offensive about a woman candidate, are we to believe that can\n",
      "translate into hundreds of thousands or even millions of voters refusing to\n",
      "support her? That assessment defies logic. Obviously, sexism can have a harmful\n",
      "effect when considering the broader issue of political socialization through the\n",
      "mass media, but we should not overinflate its importance as it relates to\n",
      "political news and voting behavior. Not only has research shown that\n",
      "frontrunners get more negative coverage (which Clinton was in 2008 and 2016),\n",
      "but also that public criticism of sexist attacks can eliminate the effectiveness\n",
      "and make it seem less credible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign built extensively on the support she earned\n",
      "in her campaign for the Democratic nomination in 2008. She won the Democratic\n",
      "nomination with 34 primary and caucus victories and a total of 17 million votes.\n",
      "She broke every fundraising record with the $500 million she raised this\n",
      "campaign cycle (not to mention the nearly $200 million in Super PAC funds). In\n",
      "the general election, she won 19 states plus the District of Columbia, 232\n",
      "electoral votes, and will win the popular vote. To say that American voters\n",
      "can't or won't vote for a woman for president no longer holds credibility.\n",
      "\n",
      "A closer examination of Clinton as a candidate is where we see many compelling\n",
      "reasons for her loss. I am on record that Clinton was an \"inherently flawed\n",
      "candidate,\" which left me skeptical for years that she could actually win the\n",
      "presidency. During this campaign, she was under investigation by the FBI for\n",
      "both her use of a private email server and fundraising at the Clinton Foundation\n",
      "while secretary of state. That, along with the baggage from her husband's long\n",
      "political career, reinforced the negative perceptions many Americans have had of\n",
      "the Clintons for years.\n",
      "\n",
      "A majority of voters did not trust her, nor did they hold a positive view of\n",
      "her. What has often helped women politicians - being more trusted among voters,\n",
      "in part, for their outsider perspective - was lost for Clinton. In addition, the\n",
      "argument that she should run on the historic nature of her campaign to be the\n",
      "first woman president fell flat months ago, as polling and focus group data\n",
      "suggested that message was hurting more than helping her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Group solidarity also did not emerge for Clinton with women voters. Despite\n",
      "projections that the gender gap would be a record-breaking 20 percent or higher,\n",
      "it was only 13 percent (similar to Barack Obama's support from women in 2008 and\n",
      "2012, as well as Al Gore's in 2000). Political scientists have long known that\n",
      "women are not a monolithic voting bloc. Research continues to show that it is\n",
      "partisan affiliation (including policy choices), and not gender, that is most\n",
      "influential in determining women's voter preference. Mitt Romney won among\n",
      "married women and white women in 2012; this time, Clinton won among married\n",
      "women, but 53 percent of white women supported Trump, proving that gender is\n",
      "just one part of the voting behavior equation.\n",
      "\n",
      "As I have long argued, despite the inevitable symbolism that will come from\n",
      "electing the first woman president, nothing will change about our constitution\n",
      "and/or presidential powers. I concluded in my 2015 book \"In It to Win: Electing\n",
      "Madam President\" that a gendered strategy is not necessary for a woman\n",
      "presidential candidate to win, and I believe the Clinton campaign proved that\n",
      "point. While some gender advantages may exist, it is the institutional,\n",
      "constitutional, nuts-and-bolts of the electoral process that ultimately\n",
      "determines the winner. Despite the advantage in fundraising, political\n",
      "experience and a superior ground game, the Clinton campaign failed to provide a\n",
      "strong narrative about why she should be elected, and failed to turn out voters\n",

      "\n",
      "\"It's such a simple, catchy phrase. On the face of it, who could argue with it?\n",
      "But it has disturbed some people.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Gates was behind 2013's Emmy-winning \"The African Americans: Many Rivers To\n",

      "President Barack Obama.\n",
      "\n",

      "'For you, it's our lifetime, but the last 50 years is really history.' \"\n",
      "\n",
      "So the conceit of the new documentary is: What would you tell civil-rights\n",

      "over the last five decades?\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You'd say there's a black man in the White House, right? And that's good. And\n",
      "he'd say, 'Wow. Was there a revolution?' \" jokes the professor.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Gates - paraphrasing Dickens - believes that for blacks, it is the best of\n",
      "times and the worst of times in America. He sees affirmative action as helping\n",
      "to create a larger middle and upper class for African Americans since 1970. Yet\n",
      "\"the child poverty rate in the black community is almost exactly the same\" as it\n",
      "was when King was murdered in 1968.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, symbolically, we have a beautiful black family in the White House, but, on\n",
      "the other hand,\" he says, \"a huge percentage of our people are still caught in a\n",

      "visited by the police. All of that is the complicated truth.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Gates, himself, knows how lucky it is to be able to escape from poverty. He grew\n",
      "up in West Virginia. His father worked in a paper mill and was a part-time\n",
      "janitor, while his mother cleaned houses. He says in 1969 he got into Yale\n",

      "\n",
      "While \"And Still I Rise\" digs into the rise of the black-power movement, urban\n",
      "tensions and political triumphs and disappointments for African Americans, in\n",

      "nuance and grace? That's what we tried to do.\"\n",

      "In the documentary, Gates delves into the conflicts within the different black\n",

      "\n",
      "For \"And Still I Rise\" - which has a companion book (HarperCollins, $35,\n",
