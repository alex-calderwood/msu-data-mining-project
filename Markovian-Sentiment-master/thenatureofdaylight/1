yet tomorrow, but the sky falls asleep. Cinder is the crunch in the leaves, and with my eyes, I funnel maple into your veins. You become the middle of my heart, my voice.</p><p>The hillside is chained by a glowing orange moon. We ready our bodies for <i>staying</i>, one of the heaviest acts in the world. So we are the heavy rocks carried with this sky as it falls. It is the letting go&ndash;letting go of our hands&ndash;that is the most important part of staying.</p><p>The night doesn&rsquo;t forget our old movements. We were so fast and now we are finally still. Your car breathes, a lung in the sleepy lights. We watch from the inside, sprayed gently by the reach of nightwash, and I love you in this light as we chase the constellations.</p><p>It&rsquo;s coming for us. It must be.</p><p><b><i>ii.</i></b><br>My blood is<br>the baritone, the perspiring<br>heat, and the engine<br>rumble in me.<br>My blood is half<br>asleep. Its favorite song should<br>drone, should resound<br>in the sky.</p><p>I want it<br>through the open<br>window.<br>I&rsquo;ll let it pierce on. I love<br>my blood&rsquo;s<br>sadness it gifted<br>me: to grow beside<br>love.<br>See my blood sprawled on<br>a small bed,<br>maybe not sleeping<br>much at all.</p><p>How many<br>nights now<br>does it drown in<br>its dreams?</p><p>I&rsquo;ll take my blood&rsquo;s hand to<br>the river.<br>I&rsquo;ll teach it to swim far, <br>far away. I&rsquo;ll laugh<br>when it laughs. I&rsquo;ll cry<br>harder. We&rsquo;re terrifying,<br>not-stopping, radiant<br>sharp sounds<br>dropped in blue<br>light.</p><p>Where you stand<br>on this shore is<br>never enough,<br>sometimes too much.<br>To swim your way<br>back<br>and forth is real<br>love, is<br>the love blood<br>loves.</p><p><b><i>iii.</i></b><br>When I&rsquo;m back home, it&rsquo;s
with two lives inside me&ndash; just as it&rsquo;s always been. It happens almost
immediately. I summon yellow evening like a sponge in my front yard. Lost time
settles back into my pores and in comes the quiet. Wait is only a word; this is
different; this is the pour&nbsp;of an empty sky wrung of day&rsquo;s fire.</p><p>So I dream to an old
soft lullaby. My prayers snap in the old roast of my burning. Coals choke on
the spilled glint of my sad. I&rsquo;m lost, very lost in this body; I need the words
so I can come back. Delana, won&rsquo;t you tell me you&rsquo;ll be the one that doesn&rsquo;t go
away? There&rsquo;s little sleep in my quiet, but I swear all my verses are yours.
I&rsquo;m not always a boy become an island.</p><p>And at midnight, call
my name when you wake. I&rsquo;ll be there in your sleeping brightness, calmness,
uncovering; I&rsquo;ll be your verbal promise that it&rsquo;s more than forever. Here is
the familiar:&nbsp;the heel catching in the soil, the eyes
lost in the sky, and the right hand holding the sun. Delana, you make sound&ndash;
you make me&ndash; come back to the okay.&nbsp;I&rsquo;m driving to you, driving to you
now.<br></p><p><b><i>iv.</i></b><br>I&rsquo;m thankful for the
constant sunburst, the curious and the mellow in me, the same waiting that leaves room to
learn, and Delana&rsquo;s love. I&rsquo;m happy in my family, in love, and in health&ndash; and
there is more to that than one should ever take for granted. I eat the moon from the sky as though a peach from a tree, with eyes dancing to the dance of bird flocks, and write it all down to remember. I&rsquo;m new every morning, new every night, but to stay is the truest gift. To stay where she sleeps, to be where she wakes. To stay a mother&rsquo;s son, to accept a father&rsquo;s love. To stay a brother and speak friendship to the roaming and lost. These honors recreate the story of my beating heart. More than forever, I promise to stay.<br></p>

                            <h2>With Two Sets of Lungs</h2>
                        

                        <p>A belt of midnight and dead stars, for centuries still gleaming, and I&rsquo;m happy to be alive. I&rsquo;m alive in the month swathed in spiced air and shared sheets. Delana&rsquo;s name shining like a cymbal at the base of my throat. I&rsquo;m alive watching it course swingsets around the room, followed by my breath&rsquo;s burnt dusk. And I&rsquo;m alive in her sweet laugh, in the strange accents she deploys at any given moment, in her before-bed routines, and I&rsquo;m alive in her sadness too. Here under the moon, there aches an old lachrymose light, lime green, and its just like a weekend spent on Long Island. I hear the hurried hush of a closing diner, brooms brushing, sleep waiting; I can hear Delana dreaming in my bed; I can see the sad smiles of my parents trying to make love work again. Here, it hurts in the same happy way too.</p><p>The street below is the real world, and people blink in the darkness like the springing notes of a piano. At this height, it&rsquo;s the roar that truly sings to me, the deep roar of a giant snoring beneath the earth&rsquo;s surface. A searing branch of stars combs my heart into the night. The time took my body away from me, and here I am, still alive in this dirtiness. I think my love sometimes sounds like the voice of a little boy. Everything else is&ndash; well&hellip; still everything else. It sometimes takes the youngest part of me to know what&rsquo;s real.</p>

                        <p>&ldquo;Keep,&rdquo; the warped bell tolls in
the land where no train tracks sing. October is over and I&rsquo;m a red leaf falling.
Summer has shimmered away, has done its shimmering, and what&rsquo;s dead is dead&mdash;for
now. All across the soot-sullied plain dawns the great ashen plumes, tuck me in their
blankets, kiss me goodnight. And there&rsquo;s a chorus of eyelids pulsing a dream:
<i>heaven is nothing but below our feet</i>.</p><p>If there are many tomorrows after the next one, I hope they contain silences&ndash;silences long enough for my eyes to adjust to the dancing light, and know a god whose eyelids pulse too, like frail
butterflies while she dreams. I remember a morning I woke and Delana drove me
into the mountains where stars swept our spirits into the current of a simultaneous
cascade, earth and sky coalescing, a swarm of little wishes and hazel light. I looked
at her in the front seat of her car and time stopped.</p><p>I
believe I am the forever&rsquo;s I speak. As the turnstile of my heart registers my melancholy, I still
speak. A resonant tone must keep, driving my heart onward. &ldquo;Forever,&rdquo; in a city where the palest buildings turn purple come the evening&rsquo;s limbs, collapsing, hugging the bark of my being. I wake in forever,
walk its course under red leaves, falling but alive, aware. Willows sing on
the inside; birds make their nests and clog the sky&rsquo;s veins. I&rsquo;m a red leaf falling, an echo
rewound, but I want to love forever. I know I can love <i>forever.</i></p><p>I&rsquo;m
going to take her back to my home. Catch the train track&rsquo;s song. It sounds
like mine. I want to sleep with her in the same bed I dreamed of her&mdash;before
her. I want to tell her forever. And if the future comes, I want harps playing
while we melt into the shiver, asleep in the greyscale of dull earth&rsquo;s November
and its scattered stars. I&rsquo;ve imagined my death but only to remember what&rsquo;s
most important, Delana. Sleep with me this month under the moon and tell me it&rsquo;s
good.<i> Heaven is nothing but below our feet</i>. And I will write every night, every
night, to feel it&rsquo;s real.</p>

fire extinguished: a crying child,<br>a seed.</p>

                            <h2>My Solitude Asleep in Yellow</h2>
                        

                        <p>I can almost smell firewood burn. I can almost hear the wind
laugh. It&rsquo;s been a year since the leaves were carmine, firebrick, and burgundy;
branches faced whatever sunlight that shined. Acorns slept in the gutters
between cigarette butts and soot, and all the streetlights loomed like owls.
Each morning would pursue an echo that roused blackness between stars. <i>I want to go, go far, far away</i>. So long
ago words felt like they could change me, and once spoken into the air, they
turned back to me weeping like I had abandoned them. I always felt sorry for the
little things I spoke. And what did I pray for when I slept alone? Delana, I
would reread the letter you gave me before I left DC. I didn&rsquo;t know I was in
love with something else.</p><p>In the mornings, I walked into my backyard and confused my disease
with indica strains and the sprawling canopy light, let my body rouse the
island&rsquo;s silence to a message I needed to hear. &ldquo;Stop,&rdquo; it shouted. &ldquo;Just be.
Just let yourself be.&rdquo; My heart raced at the voice, not yet the words.</p><p>Then I crossed state lines and made my home near you. Your hair
shorter, like the days. We were like the night. The scents of timber and
mountain air tongued like lovers, where starlets fell on Connecticut Avenue,
whispering &ldquo;Just be. Just let yourself be.&rdquo; Imagine feeling the river drink
your skin. I&rsquo;m not the wall to your voice. You&rsquo;re not a mystery unfolding. I&rsquo;ve
come to live in the sounds of your life like a song I&rsquo;ve cried to, a song I&rsquo;ve
prayed to. I drank beside you with the snow falling. With the blonde breath soaking
through thin blinds, and the murmurs of our friends surrounding, three throbs rang
in my throat of<i> will you let me sleep
beside you</i>?</p><p>My spine is built of fire and stone, and I yell come home
blue sky over a ragged heart. It races. It races. It speaks, <i>be, </i>just<i> be</i>. And when I try, I let my frail soul collapse out of me, to drain
like shower water into your birthmarks. And become lost to your youth&mdash;a year&rsquo;s
drift inside one another, to chase a current that goes on and on and on (and on
and on and on and on). The walls of the world inside you fossilized in amber
and cocoa, all tunneling toward, tunneling toward&hellip;</p><p>Always words like always. It feels like always. Our years tangled like
lines on a map. Delana, with your hair everywhere and in my hands before sleep,
dream New Jersey and ocean waves, outstretched hands, and reread letters. While
the wind laughs in a whisper, bright and long the streetlight&rsquo;s loom; while September
smells like firewood burning; I&rsquo;ll hold you always and know my home.</p>

                            <h2>The Waves Crashed Behind You</h2>
                        

                        <p>What if there&rsquo;s a star that spends its time watching my life, the years spread out like a cinema on their side of space? I wonder its waveform. I once swam in a bright green world, so let my sleep there induce a dream beautiful enough to keep, to rest, to stay stay stay.</p><p>I&rsquo;m not running away anymore. The night is still long, waiting for the robins to silence fear with a simple song. I&rsquo;ve walked under the darkness many times enough to invent some sort of melody. Come to me, let me love you, don&rsquo;t leave me, goodbye. Come to me, and walk the earth with me, don&rsquo;t leave me. I see a furious boy wading in the creek, trying to fill a jar with sunlit water, cursed to find its brightness forever fading in the dark.</p><p>It&rsquo;s deep inside of me&ndash; these questions that breathe in my heart&rsquo;s pasture, gently heaving blue from the sky. O the first place I ever loved is gone. They cut the trees down. O I just saw Jordan in the face of someone living. O and I saw the faces of friends replaced. I hope their ghosts never leave completely. O and I&rsquo;ve loved some people too desperately, and escaped their lives as demanded. I forgave, forgot. O the run, the run, the always running away. But let me ask: Can I be loved with my voice turned quiet? Will you love me with my voice turned quiet and my heart screaming? The sound so awfully loud&ndash; will you sit and listen with me? Will you speak back? Will you teach me this new language? Will you love a newer me? Say it. Please. Forever. It could be more than just a word.</p><p>Maybe someday I&rsquo;ll find a bright green world to live in. The autumn is shy, but I want years of fog pale November, and the never-ending waltz of white gale. No phantoms, but love quivering on every doorstep like evening light. Haunting, sometimes. Then there&rsquo;s us. You&rsquo;re whispering,&nbsp;&ldquo;stay,&rdquo; like you always do. I will. I always will.</p>

                            <h2>Your Eyes the Color of Inside the Earth</h2>
                        

                        <p>Sometimes the crows blend together with the sky just slightly enough that I don&rsquo;t see the life in our world. All of it. Unchanging. A train curls its tail, a fox curls its tail, and like I did 23 years ago, my body curls into sleep. And I&rsquo;ll hold, hold myself there till morning. My soul is not dream, but dreamer. And Delana is here dreaming with me.<br></p><p>I want to watch the fire burn the Earth someday in the summertime, and grow up in the fall. I&rsquo;ll fathom the sentences spilled from treetops and echoing branches, the space between I&rsquo;ll fall through, to the gentle carry, my thoughts, my journey, and waking up again in Delana&rsquo;s apartment, my hands spread on her back, carnation light pulling us to and from the windows to recite back the sacred sound. She loves, she loves me. Chorus alive in the distant roam of my ghosts, away outside, away years into the past. And here, my body a vapor dressing her, to listen to the sound. She loves me, she loves.</p><p>So call me when our moon swells and sobs, to drink the highlighter through the streets in our city. Never silent, never still, we drink the lights from the streets. Call me with your hands on the wheel, highway slowly delivering the memories of every home you&rsquo;ve ever had. All I ever wanted was something promised to me. The catch of your eyes and my story resounding. Reminding. I love, I love you.</p><p>Your name over the clouds, over the stars. 23 years, the oceans sail under time, above time, drowning time. It doesn&rsquo;t exist anymore. Why am I who I am? Could my body be more afraid of the earth? With skin thin enough you may sink inside? But two days ago the earth caught me from below, seaborne twines forming from deep inside, and so deep the music came. 

And there you were, your eyes repeating the same colors asleep inside of the earth. I love you Delana, kindled in midnight as the beach collapsed itself in love, like some pulse caught in my throat. Where is my life&rsquo;s thrum&ndash; but these waves and stars colliding? Do you feel them deeply in you too? I am, you are, I am, you are, I am, the water, the stars, now currents on the wind and carried, cast and carried away. And now I go everywhere with you.</p>

                        <p>Will my goodness spoil with the sun as it falls during its course? Has each day passed sufficiently into the past forever, where my eyes can never reach? When will the time come that my heart unwinds entirely, all to begin again? I see my friends separate to continents around the world, seas rolling between. And on the waves, fear is my sailor. Come blind my heart to the water&rsquo;s edge, die while sobbing on the mainland. The last words I&rsquo;ll speak aren&rsquo;t enough.</p><p>I want to tell my mother and father I&rsquo;m sorry I don&rsquo;t look like the young boy they created. I recall each November shaded with that pale feeling. To set my eyes up and away, to our names crested on dead stars gazing back. I see myself there: some affluent neighborhood resting on wood and water, born again on the sidewalks with my brother Andrew and my dog Monster, raising our laughter over our parents&rsquo; heartbreak. Every cul de sac was tethered together only by the echos of our stomping feet. The songs we liked were the ones we could scream to, melodies booming like torrents from our lungs. We roused hatred from our veins when the sky fell, melting into water too.</p><p>Disenchantment. Maybe that&rsquo;s what this feeling is. And a little self-imprisonment. I remember humming in my bed while my parents screamed at each other from the next room. I couldn&rsquo;t hear my own thoughts. And a whitewashed ceiling combed over. And a whitewashed ceiling combed over again. And I made a wish to fall deeply in love or die trying.</p><p>So the heart does grow forests out of cinder: to burn it down again. As the years go, I feel a dull light pierce through my mind&rsquo;s shallow graveyard. Rekindling. It&rsquo;s forever and always.</p><p>I love my hands for the way they remember. I love my eyes for the way they dream. And I love my darkness for the way it returns, to teach me goodness again. These things were developed by my own soul. Hope&ndash; my earnest defense against the rotation of the sun. Let it curl over me like salt over the brine.</p>

                            <h2>Chamber</h2>
                        

                        <p>At the Wyandanch train station, there is a timid yellow that rides the platform into the distance. One moment you see it, another you don&rsquo;t. It feels like that thing inside of you&ndash; when you&rsquo;re crying, and you&rsquo;re crying with such vigor, that you hear yourself making the most obnoxious of noises, and rising independently from your soul is a sort of self-acknowledgement: <i>The tears are spilling from my eyes now. They will end soon, but for now, I am crying. </i>How dare the mind have such an obvious way out? I wonder&ndash; but for now the train&rsquo;s voice is a falling mountain on all our heads. The echo of our lives. Every tree on Long Island shakes towards the sea, wants to love, wants to feel love. I drove past these tracks for years and happily culled the apathy from my gardened mind, resting it at the forefront of my face so I may greet Manhattan anew. And each time I was afraid of change. I think I&rsquo;ve always been that way.</p><p>Tomorrow I&rsquo;ll be back with my new love beside me. Can Deer Park rest with us inside its chamber, like lightning bugs in a divine heat? I want dry air and thick sun rays, and the Long Island Railroad&rsquo;s captivating roar. I want Robert Moses Beach to comb its salt over suburban roofs, passing us on my porch. A half-dream of tears, waking up to our real lives, to the tiny hairs on our arms touching, to the scent of Sunday in my high school bedroom, retreating from slow sorrow to the youth before our eyes. We can go here: where I laughed my sadness off in the pine barren of an island, clinging tight to the mainland, while my body cried&nbsp;<i>please don&rsquo;t leave me</i>, and still, and yet, finding my spirit awash in the Atlantic. There is no cradle for the now. Just a timid yellow that spills over, reminding. And oh&ndash; I am alive. We&rsquo;ll go see my home, and then we&rsquo;ll go home together.</p>

                            <h2>Eight Secrets to Whisper to Myself</h2>
                        

                        <ol><li>I know that every leaf owns its own prints. My bones are creaking at the thought.</li><li>Death waits inside me, and I am enriched by her prayer. This is not acid in my chest. This is my soul reaching out, burning.<br></li><li>The words that come to me when I&rsquo;m alone are not so terribly different from when I&rsquo;m surrounded. They are just louder.</li><li>Maybe 23 years under a blue sky has made me restless. I know my name isn&rsquo;t a cardboard box I must squeeze inside.<br></li><li>Sometime last year, I became acquainted with a quiet feeling. It&rsquo;s been scrubbed till raw, bloodied, and unable to sleep. Unanswered for its whole life. I fell in lust with this feeling, a pure voice that wonders its role. I&rsquo;ll show it to the girl I love. I&rsquo;ll take it and carry it to caves and beaches, night drives and dances. I&rsquo;ll take it to blacktops in the summer. I&rsquo;ll take it with me to my bed&ndash; the quietest feeling in the world.</li><li>Some say the story feels the same everyday. A long time under the same stars. But last night, I floated with the sound of my own voice as it carried Delana into sleep.&nbsp;&ldquo;What do you see when you close your eyes?&rdquo; She told me, <i>hearts</i>. I imagined them beating furiously through black shadow, thumping through the dark sheet of her vision. I imagined her life is like mine. Waiting and willing, holding, terrified, and filled with eager silence. The story feels similar everyday, just enough to keep us hopeful for tomorrow. But sometimes Delana and I sleep in the same place. Sometimes we feel the weight slide. Sometimes we don&rsquo;t carry our identities to bed, and it&rsquo;s beautiful&ndash;with her hair scattered about like stardust through space.</li><li>I was born at the end of August 1993 with a birthmark on my arm about the size of a strawberry. It has since faded away, but I linger, perhaps to recreate proof of my birth outside my body. There is so much contradiction here. So it is love. It is love, I&rsquo;ve decided, which must be the only thing I&rsquo;ve ever known. I will love to prove I exist.</li><li>Summer is here. The highways are long and liquored with light, winding through mountains and valleys. I will feel teenage life call from the bedrock of my blood. I don&rsquo;t want to waste this all&ndash; not tonight.</li></ol>
