Donald Trump is the president-elect and yet the popular vote lead for failed Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton continued to grow Wednesday. The former secretary of state led by 2.37 million votes over Trump, according to a Cook Political Report analysis.

Clinton has registered 64,902,584 votes to Trump's 62,536,347. That's good for a 1.8 percentage point lead, a slight uptick from earlier this week when Clinton led by 1.7 percentage points. Clinton's popular vote lead is unlikely to move much from where it currently stands.

Of course, the election is not decided by popular vote but rather the Electoral College. Trump scored important victories in states like Wisconsin, Michigan, Florida, North Carolina and Pennsylvania to earn 306 electoral votes, well over the 270 needed to clinch the presidency.
